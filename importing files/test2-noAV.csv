After pressing Congress to work on initiatives he proposed months before, the President updates Congress on the Indian situation, and he urges the country to open the justice system to the Indians wishing to use it.^	^<p> I meet you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which   are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situation of   our common Country, and by a persuasion equally strong that the labours of the   present45 Session, which has just commenced, will, under the guidance of a spirit   no less prudent than patriotic, issue in measures, conducive to the stability   and increase of national prosperity. </p><p>  Numerous as are the Providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments;   the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the   husbandman is too important to escape recollection. </p><p> Your own observations, in your respective situations, will have satisfied   you of the progressive state of Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce and Navigation:   In tracing their causes, you will have remarked, with particular pleasure, the   happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which   the Constitution and Laws of the United States have so eminently contributed:   And you will have observed, with no less interest, new and decisive proofs of   the increasing reputation and credit of the Nation. But you nevertheless, cannot   fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances, which   will be disclosed, in the several official communications, that will be made   to you in the course of your deliberations. </p><p> The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed   the sum allowed to be subscribed, in a single day, is among the striking and   pleasing evidences which present themselves, not only of confidence in the Government,   but of resource in the community. </p><p> In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution   of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and Resolutions   of the last Session. </p><p> Among the most important of these is the defence and security of the Western   Frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish. </p><p> Accordingly, at the same time that treaties have been provisionally concluded,   and other proper means used to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their   friendship, the well-disposed tribes of Indians; effectual measures have been   adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification   was desired upon terms of moderation and justice. </p><p> These measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to convince   the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations.   Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted however,   as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have   been crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The expeditions   which have been completed were carried on under the authority, and at the expense   of the United States by the Militia of Kentucke; whose enterprise, intripidity   and good conduct, are entitled to peculiar commendation. </p><p> Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded Tribes, and considerable   numbers of individuals belonging to them, have lately renounced all further   opposition, removed from their former situations, and placed themselves under   the immediate protection of the United States. </p><p> It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion, in future, may cease;   and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness   of the Indians, and to attach them firmly to the United States. </p><p> In order to this it seems necessary: That they should experience the benefits   of an impartial administration 46 of justice. That the mode of alienating their   lands the main source of discontent and war, should be so defined and regulated,   as to obviate imposition, and, as far as may be practicable, controversy concerning   the reality, and extent of the alienations which are made. That commerce with   them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment   towards them, and that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting   to them the blessings of civilization, as may, from time to time suit their   condition. That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ   the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate   Interests with the preservation of Peace. And that efficatious provision should   be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who, by violating their   rights, shall infringe the Treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union. </p><p>  A System corrisponding with the mild principles of Religion and Philanthropy   towards an unenlightened race of Men, whose happiness materially depends on   the conduct of the United States, would be as honorable to the national character   as conformable to the dictates of sound policy. </p><p> The powers specially vested in me by the Act laying certain duties on distilled   spirits, which respect the subdivisions of the districts into Surveys, the appointment   of Officers, and the assignment of compensations, have likewise been carried   into effect. In a matter in which both materials and experience were wanting   to guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must have   been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would   conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed   by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection, which has been used will be   found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable,   that with a view to the first, in some instances, a revision of the provision   will be found adviseable. </p><p> The impressions with which this law has been received by the community, have   been, upon the whole, such as were to be expected among enlightened and well-disposed   Citizens, from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty, however   of the tax, in a considerable part of the United States, and a misconception   of some of its provisions, have given occasion, in particular places to some   degree of discontent. But it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields   to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the   law. and I entertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives   which arise out of a just sense of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public   welfare. </p><p> If there are any circumstances, in the law, which consistently with its main   design, may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections, that   may happen to exist, it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper   variations. It is desirable on all occasions, to unite with a steady and firm   adherence to constitutional and necessary Acts of Government, the fullest evidence   of a disposition, as far as may be practicable, to consult the wishes of every   part of the Community, and to lay the foundations of the public administration   in the affection 47 of the people. </p><p>  Pursuant to the authority contained in the several Acts on that subject, a district   of ten miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States   has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which district will comprehend   lands on both sides of the River Potomack, and the towns of Alexandria and George   Town. A City has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed   before Congress: And as there is a prospect, favoured by the rate of sales which   have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public   buildings, there is every expectation of their due progress. </p><p> The completion of the Census of the Inhabitants, for which provision was made   by law, has been duly notified (excepting in one instance in which the return   has been informal, and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and   the returns of the Officers, who were charged with this duty, which will be   laid before you, will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population   of the United States borders on four Millions of persons. </p><p> It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of two millions and a   half of Florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar   to those of the one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges.   Another on like terms, for six Millions of Florins, had been set on foot under   circumstances that assured immediate completion. </p><p> Gentlemen of the Senate: </p><p> Two treaties, which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and   Six Nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification. </p><p> Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: </p><p> In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust, you must anticipate   with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily incident to the first   arrangements of a new Government, for an extensive Country, have been happily   surmounted by the zealous, and judicious exertions of your predecessors, in   co-operation with the other branch of the legislature. The important objects,   which remain to be accomplished, will, I am persuaded, be conducted upon principles   equally comprehensive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the   general weal. </p><p> The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the   Act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired, statements   from the proper department will, as soon as possible, apprize you of the exact   result. Enough, however is already known, to afford an assurance that the views   of that Act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic   debt of the United States, has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that   debt; affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public   Creditors with the System which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of   the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which   they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States,   as far as the provisions of the law have permitted, may be said to be yet more   general. The part of the debt of the United States, which remains unsubscribed,   will naturally engage your further deliberations. </p><p> It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you, that the   revenues which have been established, promise to be adequate to their objects;   and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to supercede, for the   present, the necessity of any new burthens upon our Constituents. </p><p> An Object which will claim your early attention, is, a provision for the current   service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained demands upon the   Treasury as require to be immediately discharged; and such casualties as may   have arisen in the execution of the public business, for which no specific appropriations   may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you. </p><p> Gentlement of the Senate,   and of the House of Representatives: </p><p> I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for   several objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed   any definite resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention;   and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements   of the Government, will afford you leisure to resume them with advantage. </p><p> There are, however, some of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular   mention. These are, the Militia; the Post-Office and Post-roads; the Mint; Weights   and Measures; a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States. </p><p> The first is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in   reference to the national security, to the satisfaction of the community, or   to the preservation of order. In connection with this, the establishment of   competent Magazines and Arsenals, and the fortification of such places as are   peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally present themselves to consideration.   The safety of the United States, under Divine protection, ought to rest on the   basis of systematic and solid arrangements; exposed as little as possible to   the hazard of fortuitous circumstances. </p><p> The importance of the Post-Office and Post-Roads, on a plan sufficiently liberal   and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety and facility of communication,   is increased by the instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and   proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the security of   the people, serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation   and misconception. The establishment of additional cross-posts, especially to   some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union,   cannot fail to be of material Utility. </p><p> The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity of small   change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes, strongly   recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered   into concerning the establishment of a Mint. Measures have been taken, pursuant   to that Resolution, for procuring some of the most necessary Artists, together   with the requisite Apparatus. </p><p> An uniformity in the weights and measures of the Country is among the important   objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be derived from   a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the   public Councils than conducive to the public convenience. </p><p> A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly   urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations that they are pledged   as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied,   they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the   extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal   but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the   public of its right.</p>^
^3493^	^3493^	^1805-12-03 12:00:00^	^^	^1^	^Thomas Jefferson^	^speech-3493^	^spe_1805_1203_jefferson^	^noTypes^	^noNames^	^National Archives^	^Fifth Annual Message^	^<p>At the beginning of his second term, Jefferson addresses the serious threat to ports and coastal towns posed by the Spanish and pirates, promising to arm the cities and patrol the waters with more ships. The President reassures the public that the militia system continues to work and promises to create a more able navy.</p>^	^<p>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:</p><p>  At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion and arming against each   other, and when those with whom we have principle intercourse are engaged in   the general contest, and when the countenance of some of them toward our peaceable   country threatens that even that may not be affected by what is passing on the   general theater, a meeting of the representatives of the nation in both Houses   of Congress has become more than usually desirable. Coming from every section   of our country, they bring with them the sentiments and the information of the   whole, And will be enabled to give direction to the public affairs which the   will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.</p><p>In taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice the   late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times   has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in His goodness gave it an early   termination on this occasion and lessened the number of victims which have usually   fallen before it. In the course of the several visitations by this disease it   has appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities and on the tide waters   only, incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease or by   goods carried from diseased places; that its access is with the autumn and it   disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within narrow limits of   time and space give security even to our maritime cities three fourths of the   year, and to the country always. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary,   yet to satisfy the fears of foreign nations and cautions on their part not to   be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them I have strictly   enjoined on the officers at the head of customs to certify with exact truth,   for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respecting this   fever which prevails at the place from which she sails.. Under every motive   from character and duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faithfully   executed this injunction. Much real injury has, however, been sustained from   a propensity to identify with this endemic and to call by the same name fevers   of very different kinds, which have been placed among those deemed contagious.   As we advance in our knowledge of this disease, as facts develop the source   from which individuals receive it, the State authorities charged with the care   of the public health, and Congress with that of the general commerce, will become   able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these departments.   The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as abroad; their efficacy   merits examination. Although the health laws of the States should be found to   need no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce claims that their attention   be ever awake to them.</p><p>Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably   changed. Our coasts have been infested and our harbors watched by private armed   vessels, some of them without commissions, some with illegal commissions, others   with those legal form. But committing piratical acts beyond the authority of   their commissions. They have captured in the very entrance of our harbors ,   as well as on the high seas, not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade   with us, but our own also. They have carried them off under pretense of legal   adjudication but not daring to approach a court of justice, they have plundered   and sunk them by the way or in obscure places where no evidence could arise   against them, maltreated the crews, and abandoned them in boats in the open   sea or on desert shores without food or covering. These enormities appearing   to be unreached by any control of their sovereigns, I found it necessary to   equip a force to cruise within our own seas, to arrest all vessels of these   descriptions found hovering on our coasts within the limits of the Gulf Stream   and to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.</p><p>The same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under color of seeking   enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the great annoyance   and oppression of our commerce. New principles, too, have been interpolated   into the law of nations, founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment   of nations. According to these belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its   own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the ground of its aiding that enemy   in the war; but reason revolts at such an inconsistency, and the neutral having   equal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interests of our   constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only umpire   between just nations, impose on us the obligation of providing an effectual   and determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable   nations. Indeed, the confidence we ought to have in the justice of others still   countenances the hope that a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce   from every belligerent a more correct observance of them.</p><p>With Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences have not had a   satisfactory issue. Spoliations during a former war, for which she had formally   acknowledged herself responsible, have been refused to be compensated but on   conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them. Yet the same   practices are renewed in the present war and are already of great amount. On   the Mobile, our commerce passing through that river continues to be obstructed   by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably   the boundaries of Louisana have not been acceded to. While, however, the right   is unsettled, we have avoided changing the state of things by taking new posts   or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories, in the hope that the   other power would not by contrary conduct oblige us to meet their example and   endanger conflicts of authority the issue of which may not be easily controlled.   But in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confidence. Inroads have been   recently made into the Territories of Orleans and the Mississippi, our citizens   have been seized and their property plundered in the very parts of the former   which had been actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers   and soldiers of that Government. I have therefore found it necessary at length   to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect   our citizens, and to repel by arms any similar aggressions in future. Other   details necessary for your full information of the state of things between this   country and that shall be the subject of another communication.</p><p>In reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the moderation,   the firmness, and the wisdom of the Legislature will all be called into action.   We ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as   well as of character will produce the justice we are bound to expect. But should   any nation deceive itself by false calculations and disappointment that expectation,   we must join in unprofitable contest of trying which party can do the other   the most harm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy.   Where that is competent it is always the most desirable. But some of them are   of a nature to be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it. I can not,   therefore, but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for. The first   object is to place our seaport town out of danger of insult. Measures have been   already taken for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the service of such   land batteries as may make apart of their defense against armed vessels approaching   them. In aid of these it is desirable we should have a competent number of gunboats,   and the number, to be competent, must be considerable. If immediately begun,   they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season. Whether   it will be necessary to augment our land forces will be decided buy occurrences   probably in the course of your session. In the meantime you will consider whether   it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as war so to organize   or class the militia as would enable us on any sudden emergency to call for   the services of the younger portions unencumbered with the old and those having   families. Upward of 300,000 able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 years,   which the last census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnish   a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may be wanted,   and will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall   become certain; and the reducing to the early period of life all its active   service can not but be desirable to our younger citizens of the present as well   as future times, inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced age a quiet   and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I can not, then, but   earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expediency of so modifying   our militia system as, by a separation of the more active part from that which   is less so, we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for real   and active service, and to be called to it in regular rotation.</p><p>Considerable provision has been made under former authorities from Congress   of materials for the construction of ships of war of 74 guns. These materials   are on hand subject to the further will of the Legislature.</p><p>Turning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong, I congratulate you   on the liberation of our fellow-citizens who were stranded on the coast of Tripoli   and made prisoners of war. In a government bottomed on the will of all the life   and liberty of every individual citizen become interesting to all. In the treaty,   therefore, which has concluded our warefare with that State an article for the   ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land by a small band   of our countrymen and others, engaged for the occasion in conjunction with the   troops of the ex-Bashaw of that county, gallantly conducted by our late consul,   Eaton, and their successful enterprise on the city of Derne, contributed doubtless   to the impression which produced peace, and the concluison of this prevented   opportunities of which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli   would have availed themselves to emulate the acts of valor exhibited by their   brethren in the attack of last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on the   distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late Mediterranean   service, I think it would be an useful encouragement as well as a just reward   to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment   of captains and lieutenants.</p><p>With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently explained,   but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently arrived and a mutual   disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable can not fail of dissipating   these, so that we may consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be on   as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still, it will not   be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea.</p><p>The law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of frigates   which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace, and prescribes that   they shall be manned by not more than two-thirds of their complement of seamen   and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may be trusted to two-thirds only of   her proper complement of men must depend on the nature of the service on which   she is ordered; that may sometimes, for her safety as well as to insure her   object, require her fullest complement. In adverting to this subject Congress   will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion   in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the   whole service rather than by the number of the vessels. Occasions oftener arise   for the employment of small than of large vessels, and it would lessen risk   as well as expense to be authorized to employ them of preference. The limitation   suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best adapted   to the service.</p><p>Our Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit, and others beginning   to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and household manufacture. They are   becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor and more   certainty than the forest, and find it their interest from time e to time to   dispose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means of improving   those they occupy and of subsisting their families while they are preparing   their farms. Since your last session the Northern tribes have sold to us the   lands between the Connecticut Reserve and the former Indian boundary and those   on the Ohio rom the same boundary to the rapids and for a considerable depth   inland. The Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent   to the two districts of Tennessee, and the Creeks the residue of their lands   in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Olcofauhatche. The three former purchases   are important, inasmuch as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled country   and render their intercourse secure; and the second particularly so, as , with   the small point on the river which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws,   it completes our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio from its   source to near its mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered   forever safe to our citizens settled and settling on its extensive waters. The   purchase from the Creeks, too, has been for some time particularly interesting   to the State of Georgia.</p><p>The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both houses   of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.</p><p>Deputations now on their way to the seat of Government from various nations   of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the Mississippi come   charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which   they are placed with us, of their dispositions to cultivate our peace and friendship,   and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with us. A state of our   progress in exploring the principle rivers of that country, and of the information   respecting them hitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall   receive some further relations which we have reason shortly to expect.</p><p>The receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September   last have exceeded the sum 13,000,000, which , with not quite five millions   in the Treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting other   demands to pay nearly two millions of the debt contracted under the British   treaty and convention upward of four millions of principle of the public debt   and four millions of interest. These payments, with those which had been made   in three years and a half preceding, have extinguished of the funded debt nearly   eighteen millions of principle. Congress by their act of November 10, 1803,   authorized us to borrow $1,750,000 toward meeting the claims of our citizens   assumed by the convention with France. We have not, however, made use o this   authority, because the sum of four millions and a half which remained in the   Treasury on the same 30th day of September last, with receipts which we may   calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual sum of $8,000,000   appropriated to the funded debt and meeting all the current demands which may   be expected, will enable us to pay the whole sum of $3,750,000 assumed by the   French convention and still leave us a surplus of nearly $1,000,000 at our free   disposal. Should you concur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended   by the circumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the means of doing   so.</p><p>On this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of my constituents,   I have entered on a second term of administration, I embrace the opportunity   to give this public assurance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer   faithfully the executive department, and will zealously cooperate with you in   every measure which may tend to secure the liberty, property, and personal safety   of our fellow-citizens, and to consolidate the republican forms and principles   of our Government.</p><p>In the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which I can give   for the dispatch of public business, and all the information necessary for your   deliberations, of which the interests of our own country and the confidence   reposed in us by others will admit a communication.</p>^

Significantly, Van Buren does not mention abolitionism or slavery, demonstrating the balance he showed in trying to preserve the Union.</p>^	^<p>Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</p><p>Our devout gratitude is due to the Supreme Being for having graciously continued  to our beloved country through the vicissitudes of another year the invaluable  blessings of health, plenty, and peace. Seldom has this favored land been so  generally exempted from the ravages of disease or the labor of the husbandman  more amply rewarded, and never before have our relations with other countries  been placed on a more favorable basis than that which they so happily occupy  at this critical conjuncture in the affairs of the world. A rigid and persevering  abstinence from all interference with the domestic and political relations of  other states, alike due to the genius and distinctive character of our government  and to the principles by which it is directed; a faithful observance in the  management of our foreign relations of the practice of speaking plainly, dealing  justly, and requiring truth and justice in return as the best conservatives  of the peace of nations; a strict impartiality in our manifestations of friendship  in the commercial privileges we concede and those we require from others&mdash;these,  accompanied by a disposition as prompt to maintain in every emergency our own  rights as we are from principle averse to the invasion of those of others, have  given to our country and government a standing in the great family of nations  of which we have just cause to be proud and the advantages of which are experienced  by our citizens throughout every portion of the earth to which their enterprising  and adventurous spirit may carry them. Few, if any, remain insensible to the  value of our friendship or ignorant of the terms on which it can be acquired  and by which it can alone be preserved.</p><p>A series of questions of long standing, difficult in their adjustment and important  in their consequences, in which the rights of our citizens and the honor of  the country were deeply involved, have in the course of a few years (the most  of them during the successful Administration of my immediate predecessor) been  brought to a satisfactory conclusion; and the most important of those remaining  are, I am happy to believe, in a fair way of being speedily and satisfactorily  adjusted.</p><p>With all the powers of the world our relations are those of honorable peace.  Since your adjournment nothing serious has occurred to interrupt or threaten  this desirable harmony. If clouds have lowered above the other hemisphere, they  have not cast their portentous shadows upon our happy shores. Bound by no entangling  alliances, yet linked by a common nature and interest with the other nations  of mankind, our aspirations are for the preservation of peace, in whose solid  and civilizing triumphs all may participate with a generous emulation. Yet it  behooves us to be prepared for any event and to be always ready to maintain  those just and enlightened principles of national intercourse for which this government has ever contended. In the shock of contending empires it is only  by assuming a resolute bearing and clothing themselves with defensive armor  that neutral nations can maintain their independent rights.</p><p>The excitement which grew out of the territorial controversy between the United  States and Great Britain having in a great measure subsided, it is hoped that  a favorable period is approaching for its final settlement. Both governments  must now be convinced of the dangers with which the question is fraught, and  it must be their desire, as it is their interest, that this perpetual cause  of irritation should be removed as speedily as practicable. In my last annual  message you were informed that the proposition for a commission of exploration  and survey promised by Great Britain had been received, and that a counter project,  including also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of the limits  in dispute, was then before the British government for its consideration. The  answer of that government, accompanied by additional propositions of its own,  was received through its minister here since your separation. These were promptly  considered, such as were deemed correct in principle and consistent with a due  regard to the just rights of the United States and of the state of Maine concurred  in, and the reasons for dissenting from the residue, with an additional suggestion  on our part, communicated by the Secretary of State to Mr. Fox. That minister,  not feeling himself sufficiently instructed upon some of the points raised in  the discussion, felt it to be his duty to refer the matter to his own government  for its further decision. Having now been for some time under its advisement,  a speedy answer may be confidently expected. From the character of the points  still in difference and the undoubted disposition of both parties to bring the  matter to an early conclusion, I look with entire confidence to a prompt and  satisfactory termination of the negotiation. Three commissioners were appointed  shortly after the adjournment of Congress under the act of the last session  providing for the exploration and survey of the line which separates the states  of Maine and New Hampshire from the British Provinces. They have been actively  employed until their progress was interrupted by the inclemency of the season,  and will resume their labors as soon as practicable in the ensuing year.</p><p>It is understood that their respective examinations will throw new light upon  the subject in controversy and serve to remove any erroneous impressions which  may have been made elsewhere prejudicial to the rights of the United States.  It was, among other reasons, with a view of preventing the embarrassments which  in our peculiar system of government impede and complicate negotiations involving  the territorial rights of a state that I thought it my duty, as you have been  informed on a previous occasion, to propose to the British government, through  its minister at Washington, that early steps should be taken to adjust the points  of difference on the line of boundary from the entrance of Lake Superior to  the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods by the arbitration of a  friendly power in conformity with the seventh article of the Treaty of Ghent.  No answer has yet been returned by the British government to this proposition.</p><p>With Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the remaining powers of Europe I  am happy to inform you our relations continue to be of the most friendly character.  With Belgium a treaty of commerce and navigation, based upon liberal principles  of reciprocity and equality, was concluded in March last, and, having been ratified  by the Belgian government, will be duly laid before the Senate. It is a subject  of congratulation that it provides for the satisfactory adjustment of a long-standing  question of controversy, thus removing the only obstacle which could obstruct  the friendly and mutually advantageous intercourse between the two nations.  A messenger has been dispatched with the Hanoverian treaty to Berlin, where,  according to stipulation, the ratifications are to be exchanged. I am happy  to announce to you that after many delays and difficulties a treaty of commerce  and navigation between the United States and Portugal was concluded and signed  at Lisbon on the 26th of August last by the plenipotentiaries of the two governments.  Its stipulations are founded upon those principles of mutual liberality and  advantage which the United States have always sought to make the basis of their  intercourse with foreign powers, and it is hoped they will tend to foster and  strengthen the commercial intercourse of the two countries.</p><p>Under the appropriation of the last session of Congress an agent has been sent  to Germany for the purpose of promoting the interests of our tobacco trade.</p><p>The commissioners appointed under the convention for the adjustment of claims  of citizens of the United States upon Mexico having met and organized at Washington  in August last, the papers in the possession of the government relating to those  claims were communicated to the board. The claims not embraced by that convention  are now the subject of negotiation between the two governments through the medium  of our minister at Mexico.</p><p>Nothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our relations with the different governments of South America. I regret, however, to be obliged to inform you  that the claims of our citizens upon the late Republic of Colombia have not  yet been satisfied by the separate governments into which it has been resolved.</p><p>The charge' d'affaires of Brazil having expressed the intention of his government  not to prolong the treaty of 1828, it will cease to be obligatory upon either  party on the 12th day of December, 1841, when the extensive commercial intercourse  between the United States and that vast Empire will no longer be regulated by  express stipulations.</p><p>It affords me pleasure to communicate to you that the government of Chile has  entered into an agreement to indemnify the claimants in the case of the Macectonian  for American property seized in 1819, and to add that information has also been  received which justifies the hope of an early adjustment of the remaining claims  upon that government.</p><p>The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the convention between the United  States and Texas for marking the boundary between them have, according to the  last report received from our commissioner, surveyed and established the whole  extent of the boundary north along the western bank of the Sabine River from  its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico to the 32nd degree of north latitude.  The commission adjourned on the 16th of June last, to reassemble on the 1st  of November for the purpose of establishing accurately the intersection of the 32nd degree of latitude with the western bank of the Sabine and the  meridian line thence to Red River. It is presumed that the work will be  concluded in the present season.</p><p>The present sound condition of their finances and the success with which embarrassments  in regard to them, at times apparently insurmountable, have been overcome are  matters upon which the people and government of the United States may well congratulate  themselves. An overflowing Treasury, however it may be regarded as an evidence  of public prosperity, is seldom conducive to the permanent welfare of any people,  and experience has demonstrated its incompatibility with the salutary action  of political institutions like those of the United States. Our safest reliance  for financial efficiency and independence has, on the contrary, been found to  consist in ample resources unencumbered with debt, and in this respect the federal government occupies a singularly fortunate and truly enviable position.</p><p>When I entered upon the discharge of my official duties in March, 1837, the  act for the distribution of the surplus revenue was in a course of rapid execution.  Nearly $28,000,000 of the public moneys were, in pursuance of its provisions,  deposited with the states in the months of January, April, and July of that  year. In May there occurred a general suspension of specie payments by the banks,  including, with very few exceptions, those in which the public moneys were deposited  and upon whose fidelity the government had unfortunately made itself dependent  for the revenues which had been collected from the people and were indispensable  to the public service.</p><p>This suspension and the excesses in banking and commerce out of which it arose,  and which were greatly aggravated by its occurrence, made to a great extent  unavailable the principal part of the public money then on hand, suspended the  collection of many millions accruing on merchants' bonds, and greatly reduced  the revenue arising from customs and the public lands. These effects have continued  to operate in various degrees to the present period, and in addition to the  decrease in the revenue thus produced two and a half millions of duties have  been relinquished by two biennial reductions under the act of 1833, and probably  as much more upon the importation of iron for railroads by special legislation.</p><p>Whilst such has been our condition for the last four years in relation to revenue,  we have during the same period been subjected to an unavoidable continuance  of large extraordinary expenses necessarily growing out of past transactions,  and which could not be immediately arrested without great prejudice to the public  interest. Of these, the charge upon the Treasurer in consequence of the Cherokee  treaty alone, without adverting to others arising out of Indian treaties, has  already exceeded $5,000,000; that for the prosecution of measures for the removal  of the Seminole Indians, which were found in progress, has been nearly 14  millions, and the public buildings have required the unusual sum of nearly three  millions.</p><p>It affords me, however, great pleasure to be able to say that from the commencement  of this period to the present day every demand upon the government, at home  or abroad, has been promptly met. This has been done not only without creating  a permanent debt or a resort to additional taxation in any form, but in the  midst of a steadily progressive reduction of existing burdens upon the people,  leaving still a considerable balance of available funds which will remain in  the Treasury at the end of the year. The small amount of Treasury notes, not  exceeding $4,500,000, still outstanding, and less by 23 millions than  the United States have in deposit with the states, is composed of such only  as are not yet due or have not been presented for payment. They may be redeemed  out of the accruing revenue if the expenditures do not exceed the amount within  which they may, it is thought, be kept without prejudice to the public interest,  and the revenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipated.</p><p>Among the reflections arising from the contemplation of these circumstances,  one, not the least gratifying, is the consciousness that the government had  the resolution and the ability to adhere in every emergency to the sacred obligations  of law, to execute all its contracts according to the requirements of the Constitution,  and thus to present when most needed a rallying point by which the business  of the whole country might be brought back to a safe and unvarying standard&mdash;a  result vitally important as well to the interests as to the morals of the people.  There can surely now be no difference of opinion in regard to the incalculable  evils that would have arisen if the government at that critical moment had suffered  itself to be deterred from upholding the only true standard of value, either  by the pressure of adverse circumstances or the violence of unmerited denunciation.  The manner in which the people sustained the performance of this duty was highly  honorable to their fortitude and patriotism. It can not fail to stimulate their  agents to adhere under all circumstances to the line of duty and to satisfy  them of the safety with which a course really right and demanded by a financial  crisis may in a community like ours be pursued, however apparently severe its  immediate operation.</p><p>The policy of the federal government in extinguishing as rapidly as possible  the national debt, and subsequently in resisting every temptation to create  a new one, deserves to be regarded in the same favorable light. Among the many  objections to a national debt, the certain tendency of public securities to  concentrate ultimately in the coffers of foreign stockholders is one which is  every day gathering strength. Already have the resources of many of the states  and the future industry of their citizens been indefinitely mortgaged to the  subjects of European governments to the amount of 12 millions annually to  pay the constantly accruing interest on borrowed money&mdash;a sum exceeding half  the ordinary revenues of the whole United States. The pretext which this relation  affords to foreigners to scrutinize the management of our domestic affairs,  if not actually to intermeddle with them, presents a subject for earnest attention,  not to say of serious alarm. Fortunately, the federal government, with the exception  of an obligation entered into in behalf of the District of Columbia, which must  soon be discharged, is wholly exempt from any such embarrassment. It is also,  as is believed, the only government which, having fully and faithfully paid  all its creditors, has also relieved itself entirely from debt. To maintain  a distinction so desirable and so honorable to our national character should  be an object of earnest solicitude. Never should a free people, if it be possible  to avoid it, expose themselves to the necessity of having to treat of the peace,  the honor, or the safety of the Republic with the governments of foreign creditors,  who, however well disposed they may be to cultivate with us in general friendly  relations, are nevertheless by the law of their own condition made hostile to  the success and permanency of political institutions like ours. Most humiliating  may be the embarrassments consequent upon such a condition. Another objection,  scarcely less formidable, to the commencement of a new debt is its inevitable  tendency to increase in magnitude and to foster national extravagance. He has  been an unprofitable observer of events who needs at this day to be admonished  of the difficulties which a government habitually dependent on loans to sustain  its ordinary expenditures has to encounter in resisting the influences constantly  exerted in favor of additional loans; by capitalists, who enrich themselves  by government securities for amounts much exceeding the money they actually  advance&mdash;a prolific source of individual aggrandizement in all borrowing countries;  by stockholders, who seek their gains in the rise and fall of public stocks;  and by the selfish importunities of applicants for appropriations for works  avowedly for the accommodation of the public, but the real objects of which  are too frequently the advancement of private interests. The known necessity  which so many of the states will be under to impose taxes for the payment of  the interest on their debts furnishes an additional and very cogent reason why  the federal governments should refrain from creating a national debt, by which  the people would be exposed to double taxation for a similar object. We possess  within ourselves ample resources for every emergency, and we may be quite sure  that our citizens in no future exigency will be unwilling to supply the government  with all the means asked for the defense of the country. In time of peace there  can, at all events, be no justification for the creation of a permanent debt  by the federal government. Its limited range of constitutional duties may certainly  under such circumstances be performed without such a resort. It has, it is seen,  been avoided during four years of greater fiscal difficulties than have existed  in a similar period since the adoption of the Constitution, and one also remarkable  for the occurrence of extraordinary causes of expenditures.</p><p>But to accomplish so desirable an object two things are indispensable: First,  that the action of the federal government be kept within the boundaries prescribed  by its founders, and, secondly, that all appropriations for objects admitted  to be constitutional, and the expenditure of them also, be subjected to a standard  of rigid but well-considered and practical economy. The first depends chiefly  on the people themselves&mdash;the opinions they form of the true construction of  the Constitution and the confidence they repose in the political sentiments  of those they select as their representatives in the federal legislature; the  second rests upon the fidelity with which their more immediate representatives  and other public functionaries discharge the trusts committed to them. The duty  of economizing the expenses of the public service is admitted on all hands;  yet there are few subjects upon which there exists a wider difference of opinion  than is constantly manifested in regard to the fidelity with which that duty  is discharged. Neither diversity of sentiment nor even mutual recriminations  upon a point in respect to which the public mind is so justly sensitive can  well be entirely avoided, and least so at periods of great political excitement.  An intelligent people, however, seldom fail to arrive in the end at correct  conclusions in such a matter. Practical economy in the management of public  affairs can have no adverse influence to contend with more powerful than a large  surplus revenue, and the unusually large appropriations for 1837 may without  doubt, independently of the extraordinary requisitions for the public service  growing out of the state of our Indian relations, be in no inconsiderable degree  traced to this source. The sudden and rapid distribution of the large surplus  then in the Treasury and the equally sudden and unprecedentedly severe revulsion  in the commerce and business of the country, pointing with unerring certainty  to a great and protracted reduction of the revenue, strengthened the propriety  of the earliest practicable reduction of the public expenditures.</p><p>But to change a system operating upon so large a surface and applicable to  such numerous and diversified interests and objects was more than the work of  a day. The attention of every department of the government was immediately and  in good faith directed to that end, and has been so continued to the present  moment. The estimates and appropriations for the year 1838 (the first over  which I had any control) were somewhat diminished. The expenditures of 1839  were reduced $6,000,000. Those of 1840, exclusive of disbursements for public  debt and trust claims, will probably not exceed 22 1/2 millions,  being between two and three millions less than those of the preceding year and  nine or 10 millions less than those of 1837. Nor has it been found necessary  in order to produce this result to resort to the power conferred by Congress  of postponing certain classes of the public works, except by deferring expenditures  for a short period upon a limited portion of them, and which postponement terminated  some time since&mdash;at the moment the Treasury Department by further receipts from  the indebted banks became fully assured of its ability to meet them without  prejudice to the public service in other respects. Causes are in operation which  will, it is believed, justify a still further reduction without injury to any  important national interest. The expenses of sustaining the troops employed  in Florida have been gradually and greatly reduced through the persevering efforts  of the War Department, and a reasonable hope may be entertained that the necessity  for military operations in that quarter will soon cease. The removal of the  Indians from within our settled borders is nearly completed. The pension list,  one of the heaviest charges upon the Treasury, is rapidly diminishing  by death. The most costly of our public buildings are either finished or nearly  so, and we may, I think, safely promise ourselves a continued exemption from  border difficulties.</p><p>The available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is estimated  at $1,500,000. This sum, with the expected receipts from all sources during  the next year, will, it is believed, be sufficient to enable the government  to meet every engagement and have a suitable balance, in the Treasury at the  end of the year, if the remedial measures connected with the customs and the  public lands heretofore recommended are adopted and the new appropriations by  Congress shall not carry the expenditures beyond the official estimates.</p><p>The new system established by Congress for the safe-keeping of the public money,  prescribing the kind of currency to be received for the public revenue and providing  additional guards and securities against losses, has now been several mouths  in operation. Although it might be premature upon an experience of such limited  duration to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of its influences  in correcting many evils under which the federal government and the country  have hitherto suffered, especially those that have grown out of banking expansions,  a depreciated currency, and official defalcations, yet it is but right to say  that nothing has occurred in the practical operation of the system to weaken  in the slightest degree, but much to strengthen, the confident anticipations  of its friends. The grounds of these have been heretofore so fully explained  as to require no recapitulation. In respect to the facility and convenience  it affords in conducting the public service, and the ability of the government  to discharge through its agency every duty attendant on the collection, transfer,  and disbursement of the public money with promptitude and success, I can say  with confidence tha the apprehensions of those who felt it to be their duty  to oppose its adoption have proved to be unfounded. On the contrary, this branch  of the fiscal affairs of the government has been, and it is believed may always  be, thus carried on with every desirable facility and security. A few changes  and improvements in the details of the system, without affecting any principles  involved in it, will be submitted to you by the Secretary of the Treasury, and  will, I am sure, receive at your hands that attention to which they may on examination  be found to be entitled.</p><p>I have deemed this brief summary of our fiscal affairs necessary to the due  performance of a duty specially enjoined upon me by the Constitution. It will  serve also to illustrate more fully the principles by which I have been guided  in reference to two contested points in our public policy which were earliest  in their development and have been more important in their consequences than  any that have arisen under our complicated and difficult, yet admirable, system  of government. I allude to a national debt and a national bank. It was in these  that the political contests by which the country has been agitated ever since  the adoption of the Constitution in a great measure originated, and there is  too much reason to apprehend that the conflicting interests and opposing principles  thus marshaled will continue as heretofore to produce similar if not aggravated  consequences. Coming into office the declared enemy of both, I have earnestly  endeavored to prevent a resort to either.</p><p>The consideration that a large public debt affords an apology, and produces  in some degree a necessity also, for resorting to a system and extent of taxation  which is not only oppressive throughout, but is likewise so apt to lead in the  end to the commission of that most odious of all offenses against the principles  of republican government, the prostitution of political power, conferred for  the general benefit, to the aggrandizement of particular classes and the gratification  of individual cupidity, is alone sufficient, independently of the weighty objections  which have already been urged, to render its creation and existence the sources  of bitter and unappeasable discord. If we add to this its inevitable tendency  to produce and foster extravagant expenditures of the public moneys, by which  a necessity is created for new loans and new burdens on the people, and, finally,  refer to the examples of every government which has existed for proof, how seldom  it is that the system, when once adopted and implanted in the policy of a country,  has failed to expand itself until public credit was exhausted and the people  were no longer able to endure its increasing weight, it seems impossible to  resist the conclusion that no benefits resulting from its career, no extent  of conquest, no accession of wealth to particular classes, nor any nor all its  combined advantages, can counterbalance its ultimate but certain results&mdash;a  splendid government and an impoverished people.</p><p>If a national bank was, as is undeniable, repudiated by the framers of the  Constitution as incompatible with the rights of the states and the liberties  of the people; if from the beginning it has been regarded by large portions  of our citizens as coming in direct collision with that great and vital amendment  of the Constitution which declares that all powers not conferred by that instrument  on the general government are reserved to the states and to the people; if it  has been viewed by them as the first great step in the march of latitudinous  construction, which unchecked would render that sacred instrument of as little  value as an unwritten constitution, dependent, as it would alone be, for its  meaning on the interested interpretation of a dominant party, and affording  no security to the rights of the minority&mdash;if such is undeniably the case, what  rational grounds could have been conceived for anticipating aught but determined  opposition to such an institution at the present day.</p><p>Could a different result have been expected when the consequences which have  flowed from its creation, and particularly from its struggles to perpetuate  its existence, had confirmed in so striking a manner the apprehensions of its  earliest opponents; when it had been so clearly demonstrated that a concentrated  money power, wielding so vast a capital and combining such incalculable means  of influence, may in those peculiar conjunctures to which this government is  unavoidably exposed prove an overmatch for the political power of the people  themselves; when the true character of its capacity to regulate according to  its will and its interests and the interests of its favorites the value and  production of the labor and property of every man in this extended country had  been so fully and fearfully developed; when it was notorious that all classes  of this great community had, by means of the power and influence it thus possesses,  been infected to madness with a spirit of heedless speculation; when it had  been seen that, secure in the support of the combination of influences by which  it was surrounded, it could violate its charter and set the laws at defiance  with impunity; and when, too, it had become most apparent that to believe that  such an accumulation of powers can ever be granted without the certainty of  being abused was to indulge in a fatal delusion?</p><p>To avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and its inevitable consequences  I have advocated and endeavored to carry into effect the policy of confining  the appropriations for the public service to such objects only as are clearly  within the constitutional authority of the federal government; of excluding  from its expenses those improvident and unauthorized grants of public money  for works of internal improvement which were so wisely arrested by the constitutional  interposition of my predecessor, and which, if they had not been so checked,  would long before this time have involved the finances of the general government  in embarrassments far greater than those which are now experienced by any of  the states; of limiting all our expenditures to that simple, unostentatious,  and economical administration of public affairs which is alone consistent with  the character of our institutions; of collecting annually from the customs,  and the sales of public lands a revenue fully adequate to defray all the expenses  thus incurred; but under no pretense whatsoever to impose taxes upon the people  to a greater amount than was actually necessary to the public service conducted  upon the principles I have stated.</p><p>In lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon banks of any description for  the management of our fiscal affairs, I recommended the adoption of the system  which is now in successful operation. That system affords every requisite facility  for the transaction of the pecuniary concerns of the government; will, it is  confidently anticipated, produce in other respects many of the benefits which  have been from time to time expected from the creation of a national bank, but  which have never been realized; avoid the manifold evils inseparable from such  an institution; diminish to a greater extent than could be accomplished by any  other measure of reform the patronage of the federal government&mdash;a wise policy  in all governments, but more especially so in one like ours, which works well  only in proportion as it is made to rely for its support upon the unbiased and  unadulterated opinions of its constituents; do away forever all dependence on  corporate bodies either in the raising, collecting, safekeeping, or disbursing  the public revenues, and place the government equally above the temptation of  fostering a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the necessity  of adapting its policy to the views and interests of a still more formidable  money power abroad.</p><p>It is by adopting and carrying out these principles under circumstances the  most arduous and discouraging that the attempt has been made, thus far successfully,  to demonstrate to the people of the United States that a national bank at all  times, and a national debt except it be incurred at a period when the honor  and safety of the nation demand the temporary sacrifice of a policy which should  only be abandoned in such exigencies, are not merely unnecessary, but in direct  and deadly hostility to the principles of their government and to their own  permanent welfare.</p><p>The progress made in the development of these positions appears in the preceding  sketch of the past history and present state of the financial concerns of the federal government. The facts there stated fully authorize the assertion that  all the purposes for which this government was instituted have been accomplished  during four years of greater pecuniary embarrassment than were ever before experienced  in time of peace, and in the face of opposition as formidable as any that was  ever before arrayed against the policy of an administration; that this has been  done when the ordinary revenues of the government were generally decreasing  as well from the operation of the laws as the condition of the country, without  the creation of a permanent public debt or incurring any liability other than  such as the ordinary resources of the government will speedily discharge, and  without the agency of a national bank.</p><p>If this view of the proceedings of the government for the period it embraces  be warranted by the facts as they are known to exist; if the Army and Navy have  been sustained to the full extent authorized by law, and which Congress deemed  sufficient for the defense of the country and the protection of its rights and  its honor; if its civil and diplomatic service has been equally sustained; if  ample provision has been made for the administration of justice and the execution  of the laws; if the claims upon public gratitude in behalf of the soldiers of  the Revolution have been promptly met and faithfully discharged; if there have  been no failures in defraying the very large expenditures growing out of that  long-continued and salutary policy of peacefully removing the Indians to regions  of comparative safety and prosperity; if the public faith has at all times and  everywhere been most scrupulously maintained by a prompt discharge of the numerous,  extended, and diversified claims on the Treasury&mdash;if all these great and permanent  objects, with many others that might be stated, have for a series of years,  marked by peculiar obstacles and difficulties, been successfully accomplished  without a resort to a permanent debt or the aid of a national bank, have we  not a right to expect that a policy the object of which has been to sustain  the public service independently of either of these fruitful sources of discord  will receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased and fairly elicited  judgment upon public affairs is never ultimately wrong?</p><p>That embarrassments in the pecuniary concerns of individuals of unexampled  extent and duration have recently existed in this as in other commercial nations  is undoubtedly true. To suppose it necessary now to trace these reverses to  their sources would be a reflection on the intelligence of my fellow citizens.  Whatever may have been the obscurity in which the subject was involved during  the earlier stages of the revulsion, there can not now be many by whom the whole  question is not fully understood.</p><p>Not deeming it within the constitutional powers of the general government to  repair private losses sustained by reverses in business having no connection  with the public service, either by direct appropriations from the Treasury or  by special legislation designed to secure exclusive privileges and immunities  to individuals or classes in preference to or at the expense of the great majority  necessarily debarred from any participation in them, no attempt to do so has  been either made, recommended, or encouraged by the present executive.</p><p>It is believed, however, that the great purposes for the attainment of which  the federal government was instituted have not been lost sight of. Intrusted  only with certain limited powers, cautiously enumerated, distinctly specified,  and defined with a precision and clearness which would seem to defy misconstruction,  it has been my constant aim to confine myself within the limits so clearly marked  out and so carefully guarded. Having always been of opinion that the best preservative  of the union of the states is to be found in a total abstinence from the exercise  of all doubtful powers on the part of the federal government rather than in  attempts to assume them by a loose construction of the Constitution or an ingenious  perversion of its words, I have endeavored to avoid recommending any measure  which I had reason to apprehend would, in the opinion even of a considerable  minority of my fellow citizens, be regarded as trenching on the rights of the states or the provisions of the hallowed instrument of our Union. Viewing the  aggregate powers of the federal government as a voluntary concession of the states, it seemed to me that such only should be exercised as were at the time  intended to be given.</p><p>I have been strengthened, too, in the propriety of this course by the conviction  that all efforts to go beyond this tend only to produce dissatisfaction and  distrust, to excite jealousies, and to provoke resistance. Instead of adding  strength to the federal government, even when successful they must ever prove  a source of incurable weakness by alienating a portion of those whose adhesion  is indispensable to the great aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary  attachment is in my estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government  strong in the best of all possible strength&mdash;the confidence and attachment of  all those who make up its constituent elements.</p><p>Thus believing, it has been my purpose to secure to the whole people and to  every member of the Confederacy, by general, salutary, and equal laws alone,  the benefit of those republican institutions which it was the end and aim of  the Constitution to establish, and the impartial influence of which is in my  judgment indispensable to their preservation. I can not bring myself to believe  that the lasting happiness of the people, the prosperity of the states,  or the permanency of their Union can be maintained by giving preference or priority  to any class of citizens in the distribution of benefits or privileges, or by  the adoption of measures which enrich one portion of the Union at the expense  of another; nor can I see in the interference of the federal government with  the local legislation and reserved rights of the states a remedy for present  or a security against future dangers.</p><p>The first, and assuredly not the least, important step toward relieving the  country from the condition into which it had been plunged by excesses in trade,  banking, and credits of all kinds was to place the business transactions of  the government itself on a solid basis, giving and receiving in all cases value  for value, and neither countenancing nor encouraging in others that delusive  system of credits from which it has been found so difficult to escape, and which  has left nothing behind it but the wrecks that mark its fatal career.</p><p>That the financial affairs of the government are now and have been during the  whole period of these wide-spreading difficulties conducted with a strict and  invariable regard to this great fundamental principle, and that by the assumption  and maintenance of the stand thus taken on the very threshold of the approaching  crisis more than by any other cause or causes whatever the community at large  has been shielded from the incalculable evils of a general and indefinite suspension  of specie payments, and a consequent annihilation for the whole period it might  have lasted of a just and invariable standard of value, will, it is believed,  at this period scarcely be questioned.</p><p>A steady adherence on the part of the government to the policy which has produced  such salutary results, aided by judicious state legislation and, what is not  less .important, by the industry, enterprise, perseverance, and economy of the  American people, can not fail to raise the whole country at an early period  to a state of solid and enduring prosperity, not subject to be again overthrown  by the suspension of banks or the explosion of a bloated credit system. It is  for the people and their representatives to decide whether or not the permanent  welfare of the country (which all good citizens equally desire, however widely  they may differ as to the means of its accomplishment) shall be in this way  secured, or whether the management of the pecuniary concerns of the government,  and by consequence to a great extent those of individuals also, shall be carried  back to a condition of things which fostered those contractions and expansions  of the currency and those reckless abuses of credit from the baleful effects  of which the country has so deeply suffered&mdash;a return that can promise in the  end no better results than to reproduce the embarrassments the government has  experienced, and to remove from the shoulders of the present to those of fresh  victims the bitter fruits of that spirit of speculative enterprise to which  our countrymen are so liable and upon which the lessons of experience are so  unavailing. The choice is an important one, and I sincerely hope that it may  be wisely made.</p><p>A report from the Secretary of War, presenting a detailed view of the affairs  of that department, accompanies this communication.</p><p>The desultory duties connected with the removal of the Indians, in which the  Army has been constantly engaged on the northern and western frontiers and in  Florida, have rendered it impracticable to carry into full effect the plan recommended  by the Secretary for improving its discipline. In every instance where the regiments  have been concentrated they have made great progress, and the best results may  be anticipated from a continuance of this system. During the last season a part  of the troops have been employed in removing Indians from the interior to the  territory assigned them in the West&mdash;a duty which they have performed efficiently  and with praiseworthy humanity&mdash;and that portion of them which has been stationed  in Florida continued active operations there throughout the heats of summer.</p><p>The policy of the United States in regard to the Indians, of which a succinct  account is given in my message of 1838, and of the wisdom and expediency of  which I am fully satisfied, has been continued in active operation throughout  the whole period of my administration. Since the spring of 1837 more than 40,000  Indians have been removed to their new homes west of the Mississippi, and I  am happy to add that all accounts concur in representing the result of this  measure as eminently beneficial to that people.</p><p>The emigration of the Seminoles alone has been attended with serious difficulty  and occasioned bloodshed, hostilities having been commenced by the Indians in  Florida under the apprehension that they would be compelled by force to comply  with their treaty stipulations. The execution of the treaty of Paynes Landing,  signed in 1832, but not ratified until 1834, was postponed at the solicitation  of the Indians until 1836, when they again renewed their agreement to remove  peaceably to their new homes in the West. In the face of this solemn and renewed  compact they broke their faith and commenced hostilities by the massacre of  Major Dade's command, the murder of their agent, General Thompson, and other  acts of cruel treachery. When this alarming and unexpected intelligence reached  the seat of government, every effort appears to have been made to reenforce  General Clinch, who commanded the troops then in Florida. General Eustis was  dispatched with reenforcements from Charleston, troops were called out from  Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia, and General Scott was sent to take the command,  with ample powers and ample means. At the first alarm General Gaines organized  a force at New Orleans, and without waiting for orders landed in Florida, where  he delivered over the troops he had brought with him to General Scott.</p><p>Governor Call was subsequently appointed to conduct a summer campaign, and  at the close of it was replaced by General Jesup. These events and changes took  place under the administration of my predecessor. Notwithstanding the exertions  of the experienced officers who had command there for eighteen months, on entering  upon the administration of the government I found the Territory of Florida a  prey to Indian atrocities. A strenuous effort was immediately made to bring  those hostilities to a close, and the army under General Jesup was reenforced  until it amounted to 10,000 men, and furnished with abundant supplies of every  description. In this campaign a great number of the enemy were captured and  destroyed, but the character of the contest only was changed. The Indians, having  been defeated in every engagement, dispersed in small bands throughout the country  and became an enterprising, formidable, and ruthless banditti. General Taylor,  who succeeded General Jesup, used his best exertions to subdue them, and was  seconded in his efforts by the officers under his command; but he too failed  to protect the Territory from their depredations. By an act of signal and cruel  treachery they broke the truce made with them by General MacGrab, who was sent  from Washington for the purpose of carrying into effect the expressed wishes  of Congress, and have continued their devastations ever since. General Armistead,  who was in Florida when General Taylor left the army by permission, assumed  the command, and after active summer operations was met by propositions for  peace, and from the fortunate coincidence of the arrival in Florida at the same  period of a delegation from the Seminoles who are happily settled west of the  Mississippi and are now anxious to persuade their countrymen to join them there  hopes were for some time entertained that the Indians might be induced to leave  the Territory without further difficulty. These hopes have proved fallacious  and hostilities have been renewed throughout the whole of the Territory. That  this contest has endured so long is to be attributed to causes beyond the control  of the government. Experienced generals have had the command of the troops,  officers and soldiers have alike distinguished themselves for their activity,  patience, and enduring courage, the army has been constantly furnished with  supplies of every description, and we must look for the causes which have so  long procrastinated the issue of the contest in the vast extent of the theater  of hostilities, the almost insurmountable obstacles presented by the nature  of the country, the climate, and the wily character of the savages.</p><p>The sites for marine hospitals on the rivers and lakes which I was authorized  to select and cause to be purchased have all been designated, but the appropriation  not proving sufficient, conditional arrangements only have been made for their  acquisition. It is for Congress to decide whether these conditional purchases  shall be sanctioned and the humane intentions of the law carried into full effect.</p><p>The Navy, as will appear from the accompanying report of the Secretary, has  been usefully and honorably employed in the protection of our commerce and citizens  in the Mediterranean, the Pacific, on the coast of Brazil, and in the Gulf of  Mexico. A small squadron, consisting of the frigate Constellation and the sloop  of war Boston, under Commodore Kearney, is now on its way to the China and Indian  seas for the purpose of attending to our interests in that quarter, and Commander  Aulick, in the sloop of war Yorktown, has been instructed to visit the Sandwich  and Society islands, the coasts of New Zealand and Japan, together with other  ports and islands frequented by our whale ships, for the purpose of giving them  countenance and protection should they be required. Other smaller vessels have  been and still are employed in prosecuting the surveys of the coast of the United  States directed by various acts of Congress, and those which have been completed  will shortly be laid before you.</p><p>The exploring expedition at the latest date was preparing to leave the Bay  of Islands, New Zealand, in further prosecution of objects which have thus far  been successfully accomplished. The discovery of a new continent, which was  first seen in latitude 66" 2' south, longitude 154" 27' east, and afterwards  in latitude 66" 31' south, longitude 153" 40' east, by Lieutenants  Wilkes and Hudson, for an extent of 1,800 miles, but on which they were prevented  from landing by vast bodies of ice which encompassed it, is one of the honorable  results of the enterprise. Lieutenant Wilkes bears testimony to the zeal and  good conduct of his officers and men, and it is but justice to that officer  to state that he appears to have performed the duties assigned him with an ardor,  ability, and perseverance which give every assurance of an honorable issue to  the undertaking.</p><p>The report of the Postmaster General herewith transmitted will exhibit the  service of that department the past year and its present condition. The transportation  has been maintained during the year to the full extent authorized by the existing  laws; some improvements have been effected which the public interest seemed  urgently to demand, but not involving any material additional expenditure; the  contractors have generally performed their engagements with fidelity; the postmasters,  with few exceptions, have rendered their accounts and paid their quarterly balances  with promptitude, and the whole service of the department has maintained the  efficiency for which it has for several years been distinguished.</p><p>The acts of Congress establishing new mail routes and requiring more expensive  services on others and the increasing wants of the country have for three years  past carried the expenditures something beyond the accruing revenues, the excess  having been met until the past year by the surplus which had previously accumulated.  That surplus having been exhausted and the anticipated increase in the revenue  not having been realized owing to the depression in the commercial business  of the country, the finances of the department exhibit a small deficiency at  the close of the last fiscal year. Its resources, however, are ample, and the  reduced rates of compensation for the transportation service which may be expected  on the future lettings from the general reduction of prices, with the increase  of revenue that may reasonably be anticipated from the revival of commercial  activity, must soon place the finances of the department in a prosperous condition.</p><p>Considering the unfavorable circumstances which have existed during the past  year, it is a gratifying result that the revenue has not declined as compared  with the preceding year, but, on the contrary, exhibits a small increase, the  circumstances referred to having had no other effect than to check the expected  income.</p><p>It will be seen that the Postmaster General suggests certain improvements in  the establishment designed to reduce the weight of the mails, cheapen the transportation,  insure greater regularity in the service, and secure a considerable reduction  in the rates of letter postage&mdash;an object highly desirable. The subject is one  of general interest to the community, and is respectfully recommended to your  consideration.</p><p>The suppression of the African slave trade has received the continued attention  of the government. The brig Dolphin and schooner Grampus have been employed  during the last season on the coast of Africa for the purpose of preventing  such portions of that trade as were said to be prosecuted under the American  flag. After cruising off those parts of the coast most usually resorted to by  slavers until the commencement of the rainy season, these vessels returned to  the United States for supplies, and have since been dispatched on a similar  service.</p><p>From the reports of the commanding officers it appears that the trade is now  principally carried on under Portuguese colors, and they express the opinion  that the apprehension of their presence on the slave coast has in a great degree  arrested the prostitution of the American flag to this inhuman purpose. It is  hoped that by continuing to maintain this force in that quarter and by the exertions  of the officers in command much will be done to put a stop to whatever portion  of this traffic may have been carried on under the American flag and to prevent  its use in a trade which, while it violates the laws, is equally an outrage  on the rights of others and the feelings of humanity. The efforts of the several governments who are anxiously seeking to suppress this traffic must, however,  be directed against the facilities afforded by what are now recognized as legitimate  commercial pursuits before that object can be fully accomplished.</p><p>Supplies of provisions, water casks, merchandise, and articles connected with  the prosecution of the slave trade are, it is understood, freely carried by  vessels of different nations to the slave factories, and the effects of the  factors are transported openly from one slave station to another without interruption  or punishment by either of the nations to which they belong engaged in the commerce  of that region. I submit to your judgments whether this government, having been  the first to prohibit by adequate penalties the slave trade, the first to declare  it piracy, should not be the first also to forbid to its citizens all trade  with the slave factories on the coast of Africa, giving an example to all nations  in this respect which if fairly followed can not fail to produce the most effective  results in breaking up those dens of iniquity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>^

The amount of information to be communicated as to the operations of the Government, the number of important subjects calling for comment by the Executive, and the transmission to Congress of exhaustive reports of special commissions, make it impossible to include in one message of a reasonable length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the attention of the National Legislature at its first regular session.</p><p>THE ANTI-TRUST LAW-THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS. </p><p>In May last the Supreme Court handed down decisions in the suits in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil Trust and of the American Tobacco Trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch-making and serve to advise the business world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act of 1890. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court in construing and applying this important statute, but they clarify those decisions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal construction of the act. By the decrees, they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to preserve the benefit, freedom, and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress.</p><p>NO CHANGE IN THE RULE OF DECISION-MERELY IN ITS FORM OF EXPRESSION. </p><p>The statute in its first section declares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations," and in the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several States or with foreign nations."</p><p>In two early cases, where the statute was invoked to enjoin a transportation rate agreement between interstate railroad companies, it was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonable at common law, because it was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and combinations in restraint of trade whether reasonable at common law or not. It was plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of in those cases would not have been deemed reasonable at common law. In subsequent cases the court said that the statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused to include within its inhibition, certain contractual restraints of trade which it denominated as incidental or as indirect.</p><p>These cases of restraint of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were instances which, at common law, would have been called reasonable. In the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the common law, and in defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute, only substituted for the test of being incidental or indirect, that of being reasonable, and this, without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way if the court had originally accepted in its construction the rule at common law.</p><p>It has been said that the court, by introducing into the construction of the statute common-law distinctions, has emasculated it. This is obviously untrue. By its judgment every contract and combination in restraint of interstate trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition, or of establishing in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade, is condemned by the statute. The most extreme critics can not instance a case that ought to be condemned under the statute which is not brought within its terms as thus construed.</p><p>The suggestion is also made that the Supreme Court by its decision in the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited discretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade is within the terms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at common law is well understood and is clearly defined. It does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which, in order that it shall be enforceable at all, it must be incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contract, it is void.</p><p>The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at common law to contracts or combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to control prices, or establish monopolies. The courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combinations or conspiracies might be lawful if the parties to them were only moderate in the use of the power thus secured and did not exact from the public too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that many theorists, and others engaged in business violating the statute, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts; but no court of authority has ever attempted it. Certainly there is nothing in the decisions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of judicial discretion in enforcing this statute can derive the slightest sanction.</p><p>FORCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATUTE A MATTER OF GROWTH. </p><p>We have been twenty-one years making this statute effective for the purposes for which it was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and seemed to remit to the States the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the error of that judgment was corrected, and only in the last three or four years has the heavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, but juries have felt averse to convicting for jail sentences, and judges have been most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes better understood and the committing of it partakes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law, we can be confident that juries will convict individuals and that jail sentences will be imposed.</p><p>THE REMEDY IN EQUITY BY DISSOLUTION. </p><p>In the Standard Oil case the Supreme and Circuit Courts found the combination to be a monopoly of the interstate business of refining, transporting, and marketing petroleum and its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations, the stock of which was held by a New Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer and pro rata distribution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-seven corporations to and among its stockholders; and the corporations and individual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly; and all agreements between the subsidiary corporations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined.</p><p>In the Tobacco case, the court found that the individual defendants, twenty-nine in number, had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire complete dominion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad, and that this had been done by combinations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices, and establish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin-foil and licorice used in its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarettes, and snuffs. The ' tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the statute. There was here no single holding company as in the case of the Standard Oil Trust. The main company was the American Tobacco Company, a manufacturing, selling, and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy the combination and restore competition involved the redivision of the capital and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies constituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the decree and made parties to it, and numbering, new and old, fourteen.</p><p>SITUATION AFTER READJUSTMENT. </p><p>The American Tobacco Company (old), readjusted capital, $92, 000,000; the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco Company (new), capital, $67,000,000; the P. Lorillard Company (new), capital, $47,000,000; and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (old), capital, $7,525,000, are chiefly engaged in the manufacture and sale of chewing and smoking tobacco and cigars. The former one tinfoil company is divided into two, one of $825,000 capital and the other of $400,000. The one snuff company is divided into three companies, one with a capital Of $15,000,000, another with a capital of $8,000,000, and a third with a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two one with a capital Of $5,758,300 and another with a capital of $200,000. There is, also, the British-American Tobacco Company, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital Of $26,000,000, the Porto Rican Tobacco Company, with a capital of $1,800,000, and the corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of $9,000,000.</p><p>Under this arrangement, each of the different kinds of business will be distributed between two or more companies with a division of the prominent brands in the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible but necessary. Thus the smoking-tobacco business of the country is divided so that the present independent companies have 21-39 per cent, while the American Tobacco Company will have 33-08 per cent, the Liggett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, the Lorillard Company 22.82 per cent, and the Reynolds Company 2.66 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has been taken from the defendant American Tobacco Company and has been distributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further performance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given voting power which was denied it under the old organization. The ratio of the preferred stock to the common was as 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character of the ownership and control of each company.</p><p>In the original suit there were twenty-nine defendants who were charged with being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired and exercised its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants. will hold amounts of stock in the various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maximum to 28.5 per cent as a minimum, except in the case of one small company, the Porto Rican Tobacco Company, in which they will hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine individual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock except from each other, and the group is thus prevented from extending its control during that period. All parties to the suit, and the new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpetually from in any way effecting any combination between any of the companies in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust. Each of the fourteen companies is enjoined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common directors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other.</p><p>SIZE OF NEW COMPANIES. </p><p>Objection was made by certain independent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in active business, and that the settlement that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of the capital and plant of the trust into small fractions in amount more nearly equal to that of each of the independent companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of the anti-trust law and its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital in business enterprises in which such a combination can secure reduced cost of production, sale, and distribution. It is directed against such an aggregation of capital only when its purpose is that of stifling competition, enhancing or controlling prices, and establishing a monopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided, we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the statute.</p><p>CONFISCATION NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE. </p><p>It is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of its goods in transportation, are provided, but the proceeding in equity is a specific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute.</p><p>EFFECTIVENESS OF DECREE. </p><p>I venture to say that not in the history of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the Tobacco Trust. As Circuit judge Noyes said in his judgment approving the decree:</p><p>" The extent to which it has been necessary to tear apart this combination and force it into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demonstrate that the Federal anti-trust statute is a drastic statute which accomplishes effective results; which so long as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed, and which can not be disobeyed without incurring far-reaching penalties. And, on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this organization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not to destroy, but to reconstruct; not to demolish, but to re-create in accordance with the conditions which the Congress has declared shall exist among the people of the United States."</p><p>COMMON STOCK OWNERSHIP. </p><p>It has been assumed that the present pro rata and common ownership in all these companies by former stockholders of the trust would insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies into which the trust has by decree been disintegrated. This is erroneous and is based upon the assumed inefficacy and innocuousness of judicial injunctions. The companies are enjoined from cooperation or combination; they have different managers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market, their number is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed, and its prime movers and all its participants would be at once subject to contempt proceedings and imprisonment of a summary character. The immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies under different managers, and then competition must follow, or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Only a short time will inevitably lead to a change in ownership of the stock, as all opportunity for continued cooperation must disappear. Those critics who speak of this dis</p><p>integration in the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to the inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger of attempting to evade or set at naught the solemn injunction of a court whose object is made plain by the decree and whose inhibitions are set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness</p><p>VOLUNTARY REORGANIZATIONS OF OTHER TRUSTS AT HAND. </p><p>The effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the combination of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern wholesale grocers' association, an interlocutory decree against the Powder Trust with directions by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combinations of a similar history are now negotiating with the Department of justice looking to a disintegration by decree and reorganization in accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations without general business disturbance.</p><p>MOVEMENT FOR REPEAL OF THE ANTI-TRUST LAW. </p><p>But now that the anti-trust act is seen to be effective for the accomplishment of the purpose of its enactment, we are met by a cry from many different quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress . to be an attempt to restore old-fashioned methods of destructive competition between small units, and to make impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to continued prosperity and normal growth.</p><p>In the recent decisions the Supreme Court makes clear that there is nothing in the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mere bigness of plant organized to secure economy in production and a reduction of its cost. It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of immense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly, that the statute is violated. Mere size is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants necessarily eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this elimination is in contravention of the statute only when the combination is made for purpose of ending this particular competition in order to secure control of, and enhance, prices and create a monopoly.</p><p>LACK OF DEFINITENESS IN THE STATUTE. </p><p>The complaint is made of the statute that it is not sufficiently definite in its description of that which is forbidden, to enable business men to avoid its violation. The suggestion is, that we may have a combination of two corporations, which may run on for years, and that subsequently the Attorney General may conclude that it wa's a violation of the statute, and that which was supposed by the combiners to be innocent then turns out to be a combination in violation of the statute. The answer to this hypothetical case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monopoly, they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly in mind. If what they do is merely for the purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of the bigness of the plant they are creating, then they can not be convicted at the time the union is made, nor can they be convicted later, unless it happen that later on they conclude to suppress competition and take the usual methods for doing so, and thus establish for themselves a monopoly. They can, in such a case, hardly complain if the motive which subsequently is disclosed is attributed by the court to the original combination.</p><p>NEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED. </p><p>Much is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest merchants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discussions which have been brought out in recent days by the fear of the continued execution of the anti-trust law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of action as definite and as clear as that which the Supreme Court itself lays down in enforcing the statute.</p><p>SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION NEEDED--NOT REPEAL OR AMENDMENT. </p><p>I see no objection-and indeed I can see decided advantages-in the enactment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced in the anti-trust law. The attempt and purpose to suppress a competitor by underselling him at a price so unprofitable as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give up association with other manufacturers, and numerous kindred methods for stifling competition and effecting monopoly, should be described with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the Government to shorten its task by prosecuting single misdemeanors instead of an entire conspiracy, and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of pointing out more in detail to the business community what must be avoided.</p><p>FEDERAL INCORPORATION RECOMMENDED. </p><p>In a special message to Congress on January 7, 1910, I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trusts. I said:</p><p>"But such an investigation and possible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders but of millions of wage earners, employees, and associated tradesmen must necessarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of hoarding, and produce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstances among the innocent many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish in this message to bring clearly to the consideration and discussion of Congress is whether, in order to avoid such a possible business danger, something can not be done by which these business combinations may be offered a means, without great financial disturbance, of changing the character, organization, and extent of their business into one within the lines of the law under Federal control and supervision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute.</p><p>"Generally, in the industrial combinations called 'trusts,' the principal business is the sale of goods in many States and in foreign markets; in other words, the interstate and foreign business far exceeds the business done in any one State. This fact will justify the Federal Government in granting a Federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in interstate and foreign commerce the products of useful manufacture under such limitations as will secure a compliance with the anti-trust law. It is possible so to frame a statute that while it offers protection to a Federal company against harmful, vexatious, and unnecessary invasion by the States, it shall subject it to reasonable taxation and control by the States with respect to its purely local business. * * *</p><p>"Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquiring and holding stock in other corporations (except for special reasons, upon approval by the proper Federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations in different States, which has been such an effective agency in the creation of the great trusts and monopolies.</p><p>"If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint of trade is to be effectively enforced, it is essential that the National Government shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws of the different States of the Union with respect to foreign corporations make it difficult, if not impossible, for one corporation to comply with their requirements so as to carry on business in a number of different States."</p><p>I renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of corporations to engage in trade and commerce among the States and with foreign nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law, and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible objections, have been confirmed by our experience since the enforcement of the antitrust, statute has resulted in the actual dissolution of active commercial organizations.</p><p>It is even more manifest now than it was then that the denunciation of conspiracies in restraint of trade should not and does not mean the denial of organizations large enough to be intrusted with our interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than it was then that a purely negative statute like the anti-trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commerce.</p><p>GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERTS NEEDED TO AID COURTS IN TRUST DISSOLUTIONS. </p><p>The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization into legitimate corporations, has made it especially apparent that the courts are not provided with the administrative machinery to make the necessary inquiries preparatory to reorganization, or to pursue such inquiries, and they should be empowered to invoke the aid of the Bureau of Corporations in determining the suitable reorganization of the disintegrated parts. The circuit court and the Attorney General were greatly aided in framing the decree in the Tobacco Trust dissolution by an expert from the Bureau of Corporations.</p><p>FEDERAL CORPORATION COMMISSION PROPOSED. </p><p>I do not set forth in detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation permitting and aiding the formation of combinations of capital into Federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including effective publicity, and to the closest supervision as to the issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission in the Department of Commerce and Labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that incorporation under Federal law could not exempt the company thus formed and its incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent illegal conduct, but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for frequent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorporation as to the legitimate purpose of its transactions would offer it as great security against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise.</p><p>Stich a bureau or commission might well be invested also with the duty already referred to, of aiding courts in the dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. it should be an executive tribunal of the dignity and power of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Interstate Commerce Commission, which now exercise supervisory power over important classes of corporations under Federal regulation.</p><p>The drafting of such a Federal incorporation law would offer ample opportunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management to-day, including irresponsibility of control in the hands of the few who are not the real owners.</p><p>INCORPORATION VOLUNTARY. </p><p>I recommend that the Federal charters thus to be granted shall be voluntary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fail to take advantage of the Federal incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to the careful official. scrutiny, competent supervision, and publicity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter.</p><p>ONLY SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION NEEDED. </p><p>The opportunity thus suggested for Federal incorporation, it seems tome, is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring of great industrial enterprises to the rule of action laid down by the anti-trust law. This statute as construed by the Supreme Court must continue to be the line of distinction for legitimate business. It must be enforced, unless we are to banish individualism from all business and reduce it to one common system of regulation or control of prices like that which now prevails with respect to public utilities, and which when applied to all business would be a long step toward State socialism.</p><p>IMPORTANCE OF THE ANTI-TRUST ACT. </p><p>The anti-trust act is the expression of the effort of a freedomloving people to preserve equality of opportunity. It is the result of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of the individual, his industry, his ingenuity, his intelligence, and his independent courage.</p><p>For twenty years or more this statute has been upon the statute book. All knew its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators were cynical over its assumed impotence. It seemed impossible of enforcement. Slowly the mills of the courts ground, and only gradually did the majesty of the law assert itself. Many of its statesmen-authors died before it became a living force, and they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to destroy. Now its efficacy is seen; now its power is heavy; now its object is near achievement. Now we hear the call for its repeal on the plea that it interferes with business prosperity, and we are advised in most general terms, how by some other statute and in some other way the evil we are just stamping out can be cured, if we only abandon this work of twenty years and try another experiment for another term of years.</p><p>It is said that the act has not done good. Can this be said in the face of the effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way so drastic or inhibitive in detail as either the Standard Oil decree or the Tobacco decree; but did it not stop for all time the then powerful movement toward the control of all the railroads of the country in a single hand? Such a one-man power could not have been a healthful influence in the Republic, even though exercised under the general supervision of an interstate commission.</p><p>Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful? When all energies are directed, not toward the reduction of the cost of production for the public benefit by a healthful competition, but toward new ways and means for making permanent in a few hands the absolute control of the conditions and prices prevailing in the whole field of industry, then individual enterprise and effort will be paralyzed and the spirit of commercial freedom will be dead.</p><p>PART II. </p><p>[On Foreign Relations.] </p><p>THE WHITE HOUSE, December 7, 1911</p><p>To the Senate and House of Representatives: </p><p>The relations of the United States with other countries have continued during the past twelve months upon a basis of the usual good will and friendly intercourse.</p><p>ARBITRATION .</p><p>The year just passed marks an important general movement on the part of the Powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of international disputes by arbitration rather than by war, and in response to a widespread demand for an advance in that direction on the part of the people of the United States and of Great Britain and of France, new arbitration treaties were negotiated last spring with Great Britain and France, the terms of which were de signed, as expressed in the preamble of these treaties, to extend the scope and obligations of the policy of arbitration adopted in our present treaties with those Governments To pave the way for this treat with the United States, Great Britain negotiated an important modification in its alliance with Japan, and the French Government also expedited the negotiations with signal good will. The new treaties have been submitted to the Senate and are awaiting its advice and consent to their ratification. All the essentials of these important treaties have long been known, and it is my earnest hope that they will receive prompt and favorable action.</p><p>CLAIM OF ALSOP & CO. SETTLED. </p><p>I am glad to report that on July 5 last the American claim of Alsop & Co. against the Government of Chile was finally disposed of by the decision of His Britannic Majesty George V, to whom, as amiable compositeur, the matter had been referred for determination. His Majesty made an award of nearly $1,000,000 to the claimants, which was promptly paid by Chile. The settlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations between the Republic of Chile and the United States the only question which for two decades had given the two foreign offices any serious concern and makes possible the unobstructed development of the relations of friendship which it has been the aim of this Government in every possible way to further and cultivate.</p><p>ARBITRATIONS-PANAMA AND COSTA RICA-COLOMBIA AND HAITI. </p><p>In further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the principle of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation, I am happy to advert to the part of the United States in facilitating amicable settlement of disputes which menaced the peace between Panama and Costa Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p><p>Since the date of their independence, Colombia and Costa Rica had been seeking a solution of a boundary dispute, which came as an heritage from Colombia to the new Republic of Panama, upon its beginning life as an independent nation. Although the disputants had submitted this question for decision to the President of France under the terms of an arbitration treaty, the exact interpretation of the provisions of the award rendered had been a matter of serious disagreement between the two countries, both contending for widely different lines even under the terms of the decision. Subsequently and since T903 this boundary question bad been the subject of fruitless diplomatic negotiations between the parties. In January, 1910, at the request of both Governments the agents representing them met in conference at the Department of State and subsequently concluded a protocol submitting this long-pending controversy to the arbitral judgment of the Chief justice of the United States, who consented to act in this capacity. A boundary commission, according to the international agreement, has now been appointed, and it is expected that the arguments will shortly proceed and that this long-standing dispute will be honorably and satisfactorily terminated.</p><p>Again, a few months ago it appeared that the Dominican Republic and Haiti were about to enter upon hostilities because of complications growing out of an acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had failed to solve. The Government of the United States, by a friendly interposition of good offices, succeeded in prevailing upon the parties to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Accordingly, on the friendly suggestion of this Government, the two Governments empowered commissioners to meet at Washington in conference at the State Department in order to arrange the terms of submission to arbitration of the boundary controversy.</p><p>CHAMIZAL ARBITRATION NOT SATISFACTORY. </p><p>Our arbitration of the Chamizal boundary question with Mexico was unfortunately abortive, but with the earnest efforts on the part of both Governments which its importance commands, it is felt that an early practical adjustment should prove possible.</p><p>LATIN AMERICA. </p><p>VENEZUELA. </p><p>During the past year the Republic of Venezuela celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of its independence. The United States sent, in honor of this event, a special embassy to Caracas, where the cordial reception and generous hospitality shown it were most gratifying as a further proof of the good relations and friendship existing between that country and the United States.</p><p>MEXICO .</p><p>The recent political events in Mexico received attention from this Government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation created along our southern border and the necessity for taking measures properly to safeguard American interests. The Government of the United States, in its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the so-called neutrality statutes of the Federal Government, issued directions to the appropriate officers to exercise a diligent and vigilant regard for the requirements of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual armed conflict existed, there was no official recognition of belligerency involving the technical neutrality obligations of international law.</p><p>On the 6th of March last, in the absence of the Secretary of State, I had a personal interview with Mr. Wilson, the ambassador of the United States to Mexico, in which he reported to me that the conditions in Mexico were much more critical than the press dispatches disclosed; that President Diaz was on a volcano of popular uprising; that the small outbreaks which had occurred were only symptomatic of the whole condition; that a very large per cent of the people were in sympathy with the insurrection; that a general explosion was probable at any time, in which case he feared that the 40,000 or more American residents in Mexico might be assailed, and that the very large American investments might be injured or destroyed.</p><p>After a conference with the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, I thought it wise to assemble an Army division of full strength at San Antonio, Tex., a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of Infantry in the Los Angeles district of southern California, together with a squadron of battleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a small squadron of ships at San Diego. At the same time, through our representative at the City of Mexico, I expressed to President Diaz the hope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures as to these military maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance which should cause concern to his Government.</p><p>The mobilization was effected with great promptness, and on the 15th of March, through the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, in a letter addressed to the Chief of Staff, I issued the following instructions:</p><p>It seems my duty as Commander in Chief to place troops in sufficient number where, if Congress shall direct that they enter Mexico to save American lives and property, an effective movement may be promptly made. Meantime, the movement of the troops to Texas and elsewhere near the boundary, accompanied with sincere assurances of the utmost goodwill toward the present Mexican Government and with larger and more frequent patrols along the border to prevent insurrectionary expeditions from American soil, will hold up the hands of the existing Government and will have a healthy moral effect to prevent attacks upon Americans and their property in any subsequent general internecine strife. Again, the sudden mobilization of a division of troops has been a great test of our Army and full of useful instruction, while the maneuvers that are thus made possible can occupy the troops and their officers to great advantage.</p><p>The assumption by the press that I contemplate intervention on Mexican soil to protect American lives or property is of course gratuitous, because I seriously doubt whether I have such authority under any circumstances, and if I had I would not exercise it without express congressional approval. Indeed, as you know, I have already declined, without Mexican consent, to order a troop of Cavalry to protect the breakwater we are constructing just across the border in Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado River to save the Imperial Valley, although the insurrectos had scattered the Mexican troops and were taking our horses and supplies and frightening our workmen away. My determined purpose, however, is to be in a position so that when danger to American lives and property in Mexico threatens and the existing Government is rendered helpless by the insurrection, I can promptly execute congressional orders to protect them, with effect.</p><p>Meantime, I send you this letter, through the Secretary, to call your attention to some things in connection with the presence of the division in the Southwest which have doubtless occurred to you, but which I wish to emphasize.</p><p>In the first place, I want to make the mobilization a first-class training for the Army, and I wish you would give your time and that of the War College to advising and carrying out maneuvers of a useful character, and plan to continue to do this during the next three months. By that time we may expect that either Ambassador Wilson's fears will have been realized and chaos and its consequences have ensued, or that the present Government of Mexico will have so readjusted matters as to secure tranquillity-a result devoutly to be wished. The troops can then be returned to their posts. I understood from you in Washington that Gen. Aleshire said that you could probably meet all the additional expense of this whole movement out of the present appropriations if the troops continue in Texas for three months. I sincerely hope this is so. I observe from the newspapers that you have no blank cartridges, but I presume that this is an error, or that it will be easy to procure those for use as soon as your maneuvers begin.</p><p>Second. Texas is a State ordinarily peaceful, but you can not put 20,000 troops into it without running some risk of a collision between the people of that State, and especially the -Mexicans who live in Texas near the border and who sympathize with the insurrectos, and the Federal soldiers. For that reason I beg you to be as careful as you can to prevent friction of any kind. We were able in Cuba, with the army of pacification there of something more than 5,000 troops, to maintain them for a year without any trouble, and I hope you can do the same thing in Texas. Please give your attention to this, and advise all the officers in command of the necessity for very great circumspection in this regard.</p><p>Third. One of the great troubles in the concentration of troops is the danger of disease, and I suppose that you have adopted the most modern methods for preventing and, if necessary, for stamping out epidemics. That is so much a part of a campaign that it hardly seems necessary for me to call attention to it.</p><p>Finally, I wish you to examine the question of the patrol of the border and put as many troops on that work as is practicable, and more than are now engaged in it, in order to prevent the use of our borderland for the carrying out of the insurrection. I have given assurances to the Mexican ambassador on this point.</p><p>I sincerely hope that this experience will always be remembered by the Army and Navy as a useful means of education, and I should be greatly disappointed if it resulted in any injury or disaster to our forces from any cause. I have taken a good deal of responsibility in ordering this mobilization, but I am ready to answer for it if only you and those under you use the utmost care to avoid the difficulties which I have pointed out.</p><p>You may have a copy of this letter made and left with Gen. Carter and such other generals in command as you may think wise and necessary to guide them in their course, but to be regarded as confidential.</p><p>I am more than happy to here record the fact that all apprehensions as to the effect of the presence of so large a military force in Texas proved groundless; no disturbances occurred; the conduct of the troops was exemplary and the public reception and treatment of them was all that could have been desired, and this notwithstanding the presence of a large number of Mexican refugees in the border territory.</p><p>From time to time communications were received from Ambassador Wilson, who had returned to Mexico, confirming the view that the massing of American troops in the neighborhood had had good effect. By dispatch of April 3, 1911, the ambassador said:</p><p>The continuing gravity of the situation here and the chaos that would ensue should the constitutional authorities be eventually overthrown, thus greatly increasing the danger to which American lives and property are already subject, confirm the wisdom of the President in taking those military precautions which, making every allowance for the dignity and the sovereignty of a friendly state, are due to our nationals abroad.</p><p>Charged as I am with the responsibility of safeguarding these lives and property, I am bound to say to the department that our military dispositions on the frontier have produced an effective impression on the Mexican mind and may, at any moment, prove to be the only guaranties for the safety of our nationals and their property. If it should eventuate that conditions here require more active measures by the President and Congress, sporadic attacks might be made upon the lives and property of our nationals, but the ultimate result would be order and adequate protection.</p><p>The insurrection continued and resulted In engagements between the regular Mexican troops and the insurgents, and this along the border, so that in several instances bullets from the contending forces struck American citizens engaged in their lawful occupations on American soil.</p><p>Proper protests were made against these invasions of American rights to the Mexican authorities. On April 17, 1911, 1 received the following telegram from the governor of Arizona:</p><p>As a result of to-day's fighting across the international line, but within gunshot range of the heart of Douglas, five Americans wounded on this side of the line. Everything points to repetition of these casualties on to-morrow, and while the Federals seem disposed to keep their agreement not to fire into Douglas, the position of the insurrectionists is such that when fighting occurs on the east and southeast of the intrenchments people living in Douglas are put in danger of their lives. In my judgment radical measures are needed to protect our innocent people, and if anything can be done to stop the fighting at Agua Prieta the ,ittiation calls for such action. It is impossible to safeguard the people of Douglas unless the town be vacated. Can anything be done to relieve situation, now acute?</p><p>After a conference with the Secretary of State, the following telegram was sent to Governor Sloan, on April IS, 1911 9 11, and made public:</p><p>Your dispatch received. Have made urgent demand upon Mexican Government to issue instructions to prevent firing across border by Mexican federal troops, and am waiting reply. Meantime I have sent direct warning to the Mexican and insurgent forces near Douglas. I infer from your dispatch that both parties attempt to heed the warning, but that in the strain and exigency of the contest wild bullets still find their way into Douglas. The situation might justify me in ordering our troops to cross the border and attempt to stop the fighting, or to fire upon both combatants from the American side. But if I take this step, I must face the possibility of resistance and greater bloodshed, and also the danger of having our motives misconstrued and misrepresented, and of thus inflaming Mexican popular indignation against many thousand Americans now in Mexico and jeopardizing their lives and property. The pressure for general intervention under such conditions it might not be practicable to resist. It is impossible to foresee or reckon the consequences of such a course, and we must use the greatest self-restraint to avoid it. Pending my urgent representation to the Mexican Government, I can not therefore order the troops at Douglas to cross the border, but I must ask you and the local authorities, in case the same danger recurs, to direct the people of Douglas to place themselves where bullets can not reach them and thus avoid casualty. I am loath to endanger Americans in 'Mexico, where they are necessarily exposed, by taking a radical step to prevent injury to Americans on our side of the border who can avoid it by a temporary inconvenience.</p><p>I am glad to say that no further invasion of American rights of any substantial character occurred.</p><p>The presence of a large military and naval force available for prompt action, near the Mexican border, proved to be most fortunate under the somewhat trying conditions presented by this invasion of American rights Had no movement theretofore taken place, and because of these events it had been necessary then to bring about the mobilization, it must have bad sinister significance. On the other hand, the presence of the troops before and at the time of the unfortunate killing and wounding of American citizens at Douglas, made clear that the restraint exercised by our Government in regard to this Occurrence was not due to lack of force or power to deal with it promptly and aggressively, but was due to a real desire to use every means possible to avoid direct intervention in the affairs of our neighbor whose friendship we valued and were most anxious to retain.</p><p>The policy and action of this Government were based upon an earnest friendliness for the Mexican people as a whole, and it is a matter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all factions in Mexico and of sincere friendship for the neighboring nation, without regard for party allegiance, has been generally recognized and has resulted in an even closer and more sympathetic understanding between the two Republics and a warmer regard one for the other. Action to suppress violence and restore tranquillity throughout the Mexican Republic was of peculiar interest to this Government, in that it concerned the safeguarding of American life and property in that country. The Government of the United States had occasion to accord permission for the passage of a body of Mexican rurales through Douglas, Arizona, to Tia Juana, Mexico, for the suppression of general lawlessness which bad for some time existed in the region of northern Lower California. On May 25, 1911, President Diaz resigned, Senor de la Barra was chosen provisional President. Elections for President and Vice President were thereafter held throughout the Republic, and Senor Francisco 1. Madero was formally declared elected on October 15 to the chief magistracy. On November 6 President Madero entered upon the duties of his office.</p><p>Since the inauguration of President Madero a plot has been unearthed against the present Government, to begin a new insurrection. Pursuing the same consistent policy which this administration has adopted from the beginning, it directed an investigation into the conspiracy charged, and this investigation has resulted in the indictment of Gen. Bernardo Reyes and others and the seizure of a number of officers and men and horses and accoutrements assembled upon the soil of Texas for the purpose of invading Mexico. Similar proceedings had been taken during the insurrection against the Diaz Government resulting in the indictments and prosecution of persons found to be engaged in violating the neutrality laws of the United States in aid of that uprising.</p><p>The record of this Government in respect of the recognition of constituted authority in Mexico therefore is clear.</p><p>CENTRAL AMERICA-HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA TREATIES PROPOSED. </p><p>As to the situation in Central America, I have taken occasion in the past to emphasize most strongly the importance that should be attributed to the consummation of the conventions between the Republics of Nicaragua and of Honduras and this country, and I again earnestly recommend that the necessary advice and consent of the Senate be accorded to these treaties, which will make it possible for these Central American Republics to enter upon an era of genuine economic national development. The Government of Nicaragua which has already taken favorable action on the convention, has found it necessary, pending the exchange of final ratifications, to enter into negotiations with American bankers for the purpose of securing a temporary loan to relieve the present financial tension. III connection with this temporary loan and in the hope of consummating, through the ultimate operation of the convention, a complete and lasting economic regeneration, the Government of Nicaragua has also decided to engage an American citizen as collector general of customs. The claims commission on which the services of two American citizens have been sought, and the work of the American financial adviser should accomplish a lasting good of inestimable benefit to the prosperity, commerce, and peace of the Republic. In considering the ratification of the conventions with Nicaragua and Honduras, there rests with the United States the heavy responsibility of the fact that their rejection here might destroy the progress made and consign the Republics concerned to still deeper submergence in bankruptcy, revolution, and national jeopardy.</p><p>PANAMA .</p><p>Our relations with the Republic of Panama, peculiarly important, due to mutual obligations and the vast interests created by the canal, have continued in the usual friendly manner, and we have been glad to make appropriate expression of our attitude of sympathetic interest in the endeavors of our neighbor in undertaking the development of the rich resources of the country. With reference to the internal political affairs of the Republic, our obvious concern is in the maintenance of public peace and constitutional order, and the fostering of the general interests created by the actual relations of the two countries, without the manifestation of any preference for the success of either of the political parties.</p><p>THE PAN AMERICAN UNION. </p><p>The Pan American Union, formerly known as the Bureau of American Republics, maintained by the joint contributions of all the American nations, has during the past year enlarged its practical work as an international organization, and continues to prove its usefillness as an agency for the mutual development of commerce, better acquaintance, and closer intercourse between the United States and her sister American republics.</p><p>THE FAR EAST. </p><p>THE CHINESE LOANS. </p><p>The past year has been marked in our relations with China by the conclusion of two important international loans, one for the construction of the Hukuang railways, the other for carrying out of the currency reform to which China was pledged by treaties with the United States, Great Britain, and Japan, of which mention was made in my last annual message.</p><p>It will be remembered that early in 1909 an agreement was consummated among British, French, and German financial groups whereby they proposed to lend the Chinese Government funds for the construction of railways in the Provinces of Hunan and Hupeh, reserving for their nationals the privilege of engineering the construction of the lines and of furnishing the materials required for the work. After negotiations with the Governments and groups concerned an agreement was reached whereby American, British, French, and German nationals should participate upon equal terms in this important and useful undertaking. Thereupon the financial groups, supported by their respective Governments, began negotiations with the Chinese Government which terminated in a loan to China Of $30,000,000, with the privilege of increasing the amount to $50,000,000. The cooperative construction of these trunk lines should be of immense advantage, materially and otherwise, to China and should greatly facilitate the development of the bountiful resources of the Empire. On the other hand, a large portion of these funds is to be expended for materials, American products having equal preference with those of the other three lending nations, and as the contract provides for branches and extensions subsequently to be built on the same terms the opportunities for American materials will reach considerable proportions.</p><p>Knowing the interest of the United States in the reform of Chinese currency, the Chinese Government, in the autumn of 1910 sought the assistance of the American Government to procure funds with which to accomplish that all-important reform. In the course of the subsequent negotiations there was combined with the proposed currency loan one for certain industrial developments in Manchuria, the two loans aggregating the sum Of $50,000,000. While this was originally to be solely an American enterprise, the American Government, consistently with its desire to secure a sympathetic and practical cooperation of the great powers toward maintaining the principle of equality of opportunity and the administrative integrity of China, urged the Chinese Government to admit to participation in the currency loan the associates of the American group in the Hukuang loan. While of immense importance in itself, the reform contemplated in making this loan is but preliminary to other and more comprehensive fiscal reforms which will be of incalculable benefit to China and foreign interests alike, since they will strengthen the Chinese Empire and promote the rapid development of international trade.</p><p>NEUTRAL FINANCIAL ADVISER. </p><p>When these negotiations were begun, it was understood that a financial adviser was to be employed by China in connection with the reform, and in order that absolute equality in all respects among the lending nations might be scrupulously observed, the American Government proposed the nomination of a neutral adviser, which was agreed to by China and the other Governments concerned. On September 28, 1911, Dr. Vissering, president of the Dutch Java Bank and a financier of wide experience in the Orient, was recommended to the Chinese Government for the post of monetary adviser.</p><p>Especially important at the present, when the ancient Chinese Empire is shaken by civil war incidental to its awakening to the many influences and activities of modernization, are the cooperative policy of good understanding which has been fostered by the international projects referred to above and the general sympathy of view among all the Powers interested in the Far East. While safeguarding the interests of our nationals, this Government is using its best efforts in continuance of its traditional policy of sympathy and friendship toward the Chinese Empire and its people, with the confident hope for their economic and administrative development, and with the constant disposition to contribute to their welfare in all proper ways consistent with an attitude of strict impartiality as between contending factions.</p><p>For the first time in the history of the two countries, a Chinese cruiser, the Haichi, under the command of Admiral Ching, recently visited New York, where the officers and men were given a cordial welcome.</p><p>NEW JAPANESE TREATY. </p><p>The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan, signed in 1894, would by a strict interpretation of its provisions have terminated on July 17, 1912. Japan's general treaties with the other powers, however, terminated in 1911, and the Japanese Government expressed an earnest desire to conduct the negotiations for a new treaty with the United States simultaneously with its negotiations with the other powers. There were a number of important questions involved in the treaty, including the immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff, and the right of Americans to hold real estate in Japan. The United States consented to waive all technicalities and to enter at once upon negotiations for a new treaty on the understanding that there should be a continuance throughout the, life of the treaty of the same effective measures for the restriction of immigration of laborers to American territory which had been in operation with entire satisfaction to both Governments since 1908. The Japanese Government accepted this basis of negotiation, and a new treaty was quickly concluded, resulting in a highly satisfactory settlement of the other questions referred to.</p><p>A satisfactory adjustment has also been effected of the questions growing out of the annexation of Korea by Japan.</p><p>The recent visit of Admiral Count Togo to the United States as the Nation's guest afforded a welcome opportunity to demonstrate the friendly feeling so happily existing between the two countries.</p><p>SIAM .</p><p>There has been a change of sovereigns in Siam and the American minister at Bangkok was accredited in a special capacity to represent the United States at the coronation ceremony of the new King.</p><p>EUROPE AND THE NEAR EAST. </p><p>In Europe and the Near East, during the past twelve-month, there has been at times considerable political unrest. The Moroccan question, which for some months was the cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached a stage at which it need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman Empire was occupied for a period by strife in Albania and is now at war with Italy. In Greece and the Balkan countries the disquieting potentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has been the scene of a long internal struggle. These conditions have been the cause of uneasiness in European diplomacy, but thus far without direct political concern to the United States.</p><p>In the war which unhappily exists between Italy and Turkey this Government has no direct political interest, and I took occasion at the suitable time to issue a proclamation of neutrality in that conflict. At the same time all necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal interests of American citizens and organizations in so far as affected by the war.</p><p>COMMERCE WITH THE NEAR EAST. </p><p>In spite of the attendant economic uncertainties and detriments to commerce, the United States has gained markedly in its commercial standing with certain of the nations of the Near East. Turkey, especially, is beginning to come into closer relations with the United States through the new interest of American manufacturers and exporters in the possibilities of those regions, and it is hoped that foundations are being laid for a large and mutually beneficial exchange of commodities between the two countries. This new interest of Turkey in American goods is indicated by the fact that a party of prominent merchants from a large city in Turkey recently visited the United States to study conditions of manufacture and export here, and to get into personal touch with American merchants, with a view to cooperating more intelligently in opening up the markets of Turkey and the adjacent countries to our manufactures. Another indication of this new interest of America in the commerce of the Near East is the recent visit of a large party of American merchants and manufacturers to central and eastern Europe, where they were entertained by prominent officials and organizations of the large cities, and new bonds of friendship and understanding were established which can not but lead to closer and greater commercial interchange.</p><p>CORONATION OF KING GEORGE V. </p><p>The 22d of June of the present year marked the coronation of His Britannic Majesty King George V. In honor of this auspicious occasion I sent a special embassy to London. The courteous and cordial welcome extended to this Government's representatives by His Majesty and the people of Great Britain has further emphasized the strong bonds of friendship happily existing between the two nations.</p><p>SETTLEMENT OF LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES WITH GREAT BRITAIN. </p><p>As the result of a determined effort on the part of both Great Britain and the United States to settle all of their outstanding differences a number of treaties have been entered into between the two countries in recent years, by which nearly all of the unsettled questions between them of any importance have either been adjusted by agreement or arrangements made for their settlement by arbitration. A number of the unsettled questions referred to consist of pecuniary claims presented by each country against the other, and in order that as many of these claims as possible should be settled by arbitration a special agreement for that purpose was entered into between the two Governments on the 18th day of August, 1910, in accordance with Article 11 of the general arbitration treaty with Great Britain of April 4, 19o8. Pursuant to the provisions of this special agreement a schedule of claims has already been agreed upon, and the special agreement, together with this schedule, received the approval of the Senate when submitted to it for that purpose at the last session of Congress. Negotiations between the two Governments for the preparation of an additional schedule of claims are already well advanced, and it is my intention to submit such schedule as soon as it is agreed upon to the Senate for its approval, in order that the arbitration proceedings may be undertaken at an early date. In this connection the attention of Congress is particularly called to the necessity for an appropriation</p><p>to cover the expense incurred in submitting these claims to arbitration.</p><p>PRESENTATION TO GERMANY OF REPLICA OF VON STEUBEN STATUE. </p><p>In pursuance of the act of Congress, approved June 23, 1910, the Secretary of State and the joint Committee on the Library entered into a contract with the sculptor, Albert Jaegers, for the execution of a bronze replica of the statue of Gen. von Steuben erected in Washington, for presentation to His Majesty the German Emperor and the German nation in recognition of the gift of the statue of Frederick the Great made by the Emperor to the people of the United States.</p><p>The presentation was made on September 2 last by representatives whom I commissioned as the special mission of this Government for the purpose.</p><p>The German Emperor has conveyed to me by telegraph, on his own behalf and that of the German people, an expression of appreciative thanks for this action of Congress.</p><p>RUSSIA .</p><p>By direction of the State Department, our ambassador to Russia has recently been having a series of conferences with the minister of foreign affairs of Russia, with a view to securing a clearer understanding and construction of the treaty of 1832 between Russia and the United States and the modification of any existing Russian regulations which may be found to interfere in any way with the full recognition of the rights of American citizens under this treaty. I believe that the Government of Russia is addressing itself seriously to the need of changing the present practice under the treaty and that sufficient progress has been made to warrant the continuance of these conferences in the hope that there may soon be removed any justification of the complaints of treaty violation now prevalent in this country.</p><p>I expect that immediately after the Christmas recess I shall be able to make a further communication to Congress on this subject.</p><p>LIBERIA .</p><p>Negotiations for the amelioration of conditions found to exist in Liberia by the American commission, undertaken through the Department of State, have been concluded and it is only necessary for certain formalities to be arranged in securing the loan which it is hoped will place that republic on a practical financial and economic footing.</p><p>RECOGNITION OF PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC. </p><p>The National Constituent Assembly, regularly elected by the vote of the Portuguese people, having on June 19 last unanimously proclaimed a republican form of government, the official recognition of the Government of the United States was given to the new Republic in the afternoon of the same day.</p><p>SPITZBERGEN ISLANDS. </p><p>Negotiations for the betterment of conditions existing in the Spitzbergen Islands and the adjustment of conflicting claims of American citizens and Norwegian subjects to lands in that archipelago are still in progress.</p><p>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES. </p><p>INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT. </p><p>The supplementary protocol to The he Hague convention for the establishment of an international prize court, mentioned in my last annual message, embodying stipulations providing for an alternative procedure which would remove the constitutional objection to that part of The Hague convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, has received the signature of the governments parties to the original convention and has been ratified by the Government of the United States, together with the prize court convention.</p><p>The deposit of the ratifications with the Government of the Netherlands awaits action by the powers on the declaration, signed at London on February 26, 1909 of the rules of international law to be recognized within the meaning of article 7 of The Hague convention for the establishment of an International Prize Court.</p><p>FUR-SEAL TREATY. </p><p>The fur-seal controversy, which for nearly twenty-five years has been the source of serious friction between the United States and the powers bordering upon the north Pacific Ocean, whose subjects have been permitted to engage in pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds having their breeding grounds within the jurisdiction of the United States, has at last been satisfactorily adjusted by the conclusion of the north Pacific sealing convention entered into between the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia on the 7th of July last. This convention is a conservation measure of very great importance, and if it is carried out in the spirit of reciprocal concession and advantage upon which it is based, there is every reason to believe that not only will it result in preserving the furseal herds of the north Pacific Ocean and restoring them to their former value for the purposes of commerce, but also that it will afford a permanently satisfactory settlement of a question the only other solution of which seemed to be the total destruction of the fur seals. In another aspect, also, this convention is of importance in that it furnishes an illustration of the feasibility of securing a general international game law for the protection of other mammals of the sea, the preservation of which is of importance to all the nations of the world.</p><p>LEGISLATION NECESSARY. </p><p>The attention of Congress is especially called to the necessity for legislation on the part of the United States for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations assumed under this convention, to which the Senate gave its advice and consent on the 24th day of July last.</p><p>PROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY UNION. </p><p>The conference of the International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property, which, under the authority of Congress, convened at Washington on May 16, 1911, closed its labors on June 2, 1911, by the signature of three acts, as follows:</p><p>(I) A convention revising the Paris convention of March 20, 1883, for the protection of industrial property, as modified by the additional act signed at Brussels on December 14, 1900;</p><p>(2) An arrangement to replace the arrangement signed at Madrid on April 14, 1891 for the international registration of trade-marks, and the additional act with regard thereto signed at Brussels on December 14, 1900; and</p><p>(3) An arrangement to replace the arrangement signed at Madrid on April 14, 18gi, relating to the repression of false indication of production of merchandise.</p><p>The United States is a signatory of the first convention only, and this will be promptly submitted to the Senate.</p><p>INTERNATIONAL OPIUM COMMISSION. </p><p>In a special message transmitted to the Congress on the 11th of January, 19ii, in which I concurred in the recommendations made by the Secretary of State in regard to certain needful legislation for the control of our interstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drugs, I quoted from my annual message of December 7, 1909, in which I announced that the results of the International Opium Commission held at Shanghai in February, 1909, at the invitation of the United States, had been laid before this Government; that the report of that commission showed that China was making remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradication of the opium evil; that the interested governments had not permitted their commercial interests to prevent their cooperation in this reform; and, as a result of collateral investigations of the opium question in this country, I recommended that the manufacture, sale, and use of opium in the United States should be more rigorously controlled by legislation</p><p>Prior to that time and in continuation of the policy of this Government to secure the cooperation of the interested nations, the United States proposed an international opium conference with full powers for the purpose of clothing with the force of international law the resolutions adopted by the above-mentioned commission, together with their essential corollaries. The other powers concerned cordially responded to the proposal of this Government, and, I am glad to be able to announce, representatives of all the powers assembled in conference at The Hague on the first of this month.</p><p>Since the passage of the opium-exclusion act, more than twenty States have been animated to modify their pharmacy laws and bring them in accord with the spirit of that act, thus stamping out, to a measure, the intrastate traffic in opium and other habit-forming drugs. But, although I have urged on the Congress the passage of certain measures for Federal control of the interstate and foreign traffic in these drugs, no action has yet been taken. In view of the fact that there is now sitting at The Hague so important a conference, which has under review the municipal laws of the different nations for the mitigation of their opium and other allied evils, a conference which will certainly deal with the international aspects of these evils, it seems to me most essential that the Congress should take immediate action on the anti-narcotic legislation to which I have already called attention by a special message.</p><p>BUENOS AIRES CONVENTIONS. </p><p>The four important conventions signed at the Fourth Pan American Conference at Buenos Aires, providing for the regulation of trademarks, patents, and copyrights, and for the arbitration of pecuniary claims, have, with the advice and consent of the Senate, been ratified on the part of the United States and the ratifications have been deposited with the Government of the Argentine Republic in accordance with the requirements of the conventions. I am not advised that similiar action has been taken by any other of the signatory governments.</p><p>INTERNATIONAL ARRANGEMENT TO SUPPRESS OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS. </p><p>One of the notable advances in international morality accomplished in recent years was an arrangement entered into on April 13th of the present year between the United States and other powers for the repression of the circulation of obscene publications.</p><p>FOREIGN TRADE RELATIONS OF TYTE UNITED STATES. </p><p>In my last annual message I referred to the tariff negotiations of the Department of State with foreign countries in connection with the application, by a series of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the United States to importations from the several countries, and I stated that, in its general operation, section 2 of the new tariff law had proved a guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there were, unfortunately, instances where foreign governments dealt arbitrarily with American interests within their jurisdiction in a manner injurious and inequitable. During the past year some instances of discriminatory treatment have been removed, but I regret to say that there remain a few cases of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the United States. While none of these instances now appears to amount to undue discrimination in the sense of section 2 Of the tariff law of August 5, 1909, they are all exceptions to that complete degree of equality of tariff treatment that the Department of State has consistently sought to obtain for American commerce abroad.</p><p>While the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 1909 has been amply justified by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new, undue discriminations against American commerce it is believed that the time has come for the amendment of this feature of the law in such way as to provide a graduated means of meeting varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of American commerce in foreign countries as well as to protect the financial interests abroad of American citizens against arbitrary and injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either legislative or administrative measures.</p><p>It would seem desirable that the maximum tariff of the United States should embrace within its purview the free list, which is not the case at the present time, in order that it might have reasonable significance to the governments of those countries from which the importations into the United States are confined virtually to articles on the free list.</p><p>RECORD OF HIGHEST AMOUNT OF FOREIGN TRADE. </p><p>The fiscal year ended June 30, 1911, shows great progress in the development of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the highest record of exports of American products to foreign countries, the valuation being in excess of $2,000,000,000. These exports showed a gain over the preceding year of more than $300,000,000.</p><p>FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN TRADE FURNISHED BY JOINT ACTION OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OF COMMERCE AND LABOR. </p><p>There is widespread appreciation expressed by the business interests of the country as regards the practical value of the facilities now offered by the Department of State and the Department of Commerce and Labor for the furtherance of American commerce. Conferences with their officers at Washington who have an expert knowledge of trade conditions in foreign countries and with consular officers and commercial agents of the Department of Commerce and Labor who, while on leave of absence, visit the principal industrial centers of the United States, have been found of great value. These trade conferences are regarded as a particularly promising method of governmental aid in foreign trade promotion. The Department of Commerce and Labor has arranged to give publicity to the expected arrival and the itinerary of consular officers and commercial agents while on leave in the United States, in order that trade organizations may arrange for conferences with them.</p><p>As I have indicated, it is increasingly clear that to obtain and maintain that equity and substantial equality of treatment essential to the flourishing foreign trade, which becomes year by year more important to the industrial and commercial welfare of the United States, we should have a flexibility of tariff sufficient for the give and take of negotiation by the Department of State on behalf of our commerce and industry.</p><p>CRYING NEED FOR AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE. </p><p>I need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be built up an American merchant marine. This is necessary to assure favorable transportation facilities to our great ocean-borne commerce as well as to supplement the Navy with an adequate reserve of ships and men It would have the economic advantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid foreign shipping for carrying American goods. All the great commercial nations pay heavy subsidies to their merchant marine so that it is obvious that without some wise aid from the Congress the United States must lag behind in the matter of merchant marine in its present anomalous position.</p><p>EXTENSION OF AMERICAN BANKING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. </p><p>Legislation to facilitate the extension of American banks to foreign countries is another matter in which our foreign trade needs assistance.</p><p>CHAMBERS OF FOREIGN COMMERCE SUGGESTED. </p><p>The interests of our foreign commerce are nonpartisan, and as a factor in prosperity are as broad as the land. In the dissemination of useful information and in the coordination of effort certain unofficial associations have done good work toward the promotion of foreign commerce. It is cause for regret, however, that the great number of such associations and the comparative lack of cooperation between them fails to secure an efficiency commensurate with the public interest. Through the agency of the Department of Commerce and Labor, and in some cases directly, the Department of State transmits to reputable business interests information of commercial opportunities, supplementing the regular published consular reports. Some central organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country and able to keep purely American interests in closer touch with different phases of commercial affairs would, I believe, be of great value. Such organization might be managed by a committee composed of a small number of those now actively carrying on the work of some of the larger associations, and there might be added to the committee, as members ex officio, one or two officials of the Department of State and one or two officials from the Department of Commerce and Labor and representatives of the appropriate committees of Congress. The authority and success of such an organization would evidently be enhanced if the Congress should see fit to prescribe its scope and organization through legislation which would give to it some such official standing as that, for example, of the National Red Cross.</p><p>With these factors and the continuance of the foreign-service establishment (departmental, diplomatic, and consular) upon the high plane where it has been placed by the recent reorganization this Government would be abreast of the times in fostering the interests of its foreign trade, and the rest must be left to the energy and enterprise of our business men.</p><p>IMPROVEMENT OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE. </p><p>The entire foreign-service organization is being improved and developed with especial regard to the requirements of the commercial interests of the country. The rapid growth of our foreign trade makes it of the utmost importance that governmental agencies through which that trade is to be aided and protected should possess a high degree of efficiency. Not only should the foreign representatives be maintained upon a generous scale in so far as salaries and establishments are concerned, but the selection and advancement of officers should be definitely and permanently regulated by law so that the service shall not fail to attract men of high character and ability. The experience of the past few years with a partial application of civil-service rules to the Diplomatic and Consular Service leaves no doubt in my mind of the wisdom of a wider and more permanent extension of those principles to both branches of the foreign service. The men selected for appointment by means of the existing executive regulations have been of a far higher average of intelligence and ability than the men appointed before the regulations were promulgated. Moreover, the feeling that under the existing rules there is reasonable hope for permanence of tenure during good behavior and for promotion for meritorious service has served to bring about a zealous activity in the interests of the country, which never before existed or could exist. It is my earnest conviction that the enactment into law of the general principles of the existing regulations can not fail to effect further improvement in both branches of the foreign service by providing greater inducement for young men of character and ability to seek a career abroad in the service of the Government, and an incentive to those already in the service to put forth greater efforts to attain the high standards which the successful conduct of our international relations and commerce requires.</p><p>I therefore again commend to the favorable action of the Congress the enactment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the principles embodied in section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, in the civil-service act of January 16, 1883, and the Executive orders of June 27, 1906, and of November 26, 1909. In its consideration of this important subject I desire to recall to the attention of the Congress the very favorable report made on the Lowden bill for the improvement of the foreign service by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives. Available statistics show the strictness with which the merit system has been applied to the foreign service during recent years and the absolute nonpartisan selection of consuls and diplomatic-service secretaries who, indeed, far from being selected with any view to political consideration, have actually been chosen to a disproportionate extent from States which would have been unrepresented in the foreign service under the system which it is to be hoped is now permanently obsolete. Some legislation for the perpetuation of the present system of examinations and promotions upon merit and efficiency would be of greatest value to our commerical and international interests.</p><p>PART III. </p><p>THE WHITE HOUSE, December 20, 1911.</p><p>To the Senate and House of Representatives: </p><p>In my annual message to Congress, December, 1909, I stated that under section 2 of the act of August 5, 1909, I had appointed a Tariff Board of three members to cooperate with the State Department in the administration of the maximum and minimum clause of that act, to make a glossary or encyclopedia of the existing tariff so as to render its terms intelligible to the ordinary reader, and then to investigate industrial conditions and costs of production at home and abroad with a view to determining to what extent existing tariff rates actually exemplify the protective principle, viz., that duties should be made adequate, and only adequate, to equalize the difference in cost of production at home and abroad.</p><p>I further stated that I believed these investigations would be of great value as a basis for accurate legislation, and that I should from time to time recommend to Congress the revision of certain schedules in accordance with the findings of the Board.</p><p>In the last session of the Sixty-first Congress a bill creating a permanent Tariff Board of five members, of whom not more than three should be of the same political party, passed each House, but failed of enactment because of slight differences on which agreement was not reached before adjournment. An appropriation act provided that the permanent Tariff Board, if created by statute, should report to Congress on Schedule K in December, 1911.</p><p>Therefore, to carry out so far as lay within my power the purposes of this bill for a permanent Tariff Board, I appointed in March, 19li, a board of five, adding two members of such party affiliation as would have fulfilled the statutory requirement, and directed them to make a report to me on Schedule K of the tariff act in December of this year.</p><p>In my message of August 17, 1911, accompanying the veto of the wool bill, I said that, in my judgment, Schedule K should be revised and the rates reduced. My veto was based on the ground that, since the Tariff Board would make, in December, a detailed report on wool and wool manufactures, with special reference to the relation of the existing rates of duties to relative costs here and abroad, public policy and a fair regard to the interests of the producers and the manufacturers on the one hand and of the consumers on the other demanded that legislation should not be hastily enacted in the absence of such information; that I was not myself possessed at that time of adequate knowledge of the facts to determine whether or not the proposed act was in accord with my pledge to support a fair and reasonable protective policy; that such legislation might prove only temporary and inflict upon a great industry the evils of continued uncertainty.</p><p>I now herewith submit a report of the Tariff Board on Schedule K. The board is unanimous in its findings. On the basis of these findings I now recommend that the Congress proceed to a consideration of this schedule with a view to its revision and a general reduction of its rates.</p><p>The report shows that the present method of assessing the duty on raw wool-this is, by a specific rate on the grease pound (i. e., unscoured) -operates to exclude wools of high shrinkage in scouring but fine quality from the American market and thereby lessens the range of wools available to the domestic manufacturer; that the duty on scoured wool Of 33 cents per pound is prohibitory and operates to exclude the importation of clean, low-priced foreign wools of inferior grades, which are nevertheless valuable material for manufacturing, and which can not be imported in the grease because of their heavy shrinkage. Such wools, if imported, might be used to displace the cheap substitutes now in use.</p><p>To make the preceding paragraph a little plainer, take the instance of a hundred pounds of first-class wool imported under the present duty, which is 11 11 cents a pound. That would make the duty on the hundred pounds $11. The merchantable part of the wool thus imported is the weight of the wool of this hundred pounds after scouring. If the wool shrinks 80 per cent, as some wools do, then the duty in such a case would amount to $11 $11 on 20 pounds of scoured wool. This, of course, would be prohibitory. If the wool shrinks only 50 per cent, it would be $11 on 50 pounds of wool, and this is near to the average of the great bulk of wools that are imported from Australia, which is the principal source of our imported wool.</p><p>These discriminations could be overcome by assessing a duty in ad valorem terms, but this method is open to the objection, first, that it increases administrative difficulties and tends to decrease revenue through undervaluation; and, second, that as prices advance, the ad valorem rate increases the duty per pound at the time when the consumer most needs relief and the producer can best stand competition; while if prices decline the duty is decreased at the time when the consumer is least burdened by the price and the producer most needs protection.</p><p>Another method of meeting the difficulty of taxing the grease pound is to assess a specific duty on grease wool in terms of its scoured content. This obviates the chief evil of the present system, namely, the discrimination due to different shrinkages, and thereby tends greatly to equalize the duty. The board reports that this method is feasible in practice and could be administered without great expense. The scoured content of the wool is the basis on which users of wool make their calculations, and a duty of this kind would fit the usages of the trade. One effect of this method of assessment would be that , regardless of the rate of duty, there would be an increase in the supply and variety of wool by making available to the American market wools of both low and fine quality now excluded.</p><p>The report shows in detail the difficulties involved in attempting to state in categorical terms the cost of wool production and the great differences in cost as between different regions and different types of wool. It is found, however, that, taking all varieties in account, the average cost of production for the whole American clip is higher than the cost in the chief competing country by an amount somewhat less than the present duty.</p><p>The report shows that the duties on noils, wool wastes, and shoddy, which are adjusted to the rate Of 33 cents on scoured wool are prohibitory in the same measure that the duty on scoured wool is prohibitory. In general, they are assessed at rates as high as, or higher than, the duties paid on the clean content of wools actually imported. They should be reduced and so adjusted to the rate on wool as to bear their proper proportion to the real rate levied on the actual wool imports.</p><p>The duties on many classes of wool manufacture are prohibitory and greatly in excess of the difference in cost of production here and abroad.</p><p>This is true of tops, of yarns (with the exception of worsted yarns of a very high grade), and of low and medium grade cloth of heavy weight.</p><p>On tops up to 52 cents a pound in value, and on yarns of 65 cents in value, the rate is 100 per cent with correspondingly higher rates for lower values. On cheap and medium grade cloths, the existing rates frequently run to 150 per cent and on some cheap goods to over 200 per cent. This is largely due to that part of the duty which is levied ostensibly to compensate the manufacturer for the enhanced cost of his raw material due to the duty on wool. As a matter of fact, this compensatory duty, for numerous classes of goods, is much in excess of the amount needed for strict compensation.</p><p>On the other hand, the findings show that the duties which run to such high ad valorem equivalents are prohibitory, since the goods are not imported, but that the prices of domestic fabrics are not raised by the full amount of duty. On a set of 1-yard samples of 16 English fabrics, which are completely excluded by the present tariff rates, it was found that the total foreign value was $41.84; the duties which would have been assessed had these fabrics been imported, $76.90; the foreign value plus the amount of the duty, $118.74; or a nominal duty of 183 per cent. In fact, however, practically identical fabrics of domestic make sold at the same time at $69.75, showing an enhanced price over the foreign market value of but 67 per cent.</p><p>Although these duties do not increase prices of domestic goods by anything like their full amount, it is none the less true that such prohibitive duties eliminate the possibility of foreign competition, even in time of scarcity; that they form a temptation to monopoly and conspiracies to control domestic prices; that they are much in excess of the difference in cost of production here and abroad, and that they should be reduced to a point which accords with this principle.</p><p>The findings of the board show that in this industry the actual manufacturing cost, aside from the question of the price of materials, is much higher in this country than it is abroad; that in the making of yarn and cloth the domestic woolen or worsted manufacturer has in general no advantage in the form of superior machinery or more efficient labor to offset the higher wages paid in this country The findings show that the cost of turning wool into yarn in this country is about double that in the leading competing country, and that the cost of turning yarn into cloth is somewhat more than double. Under the protective policy a great industry, involving the welfare of hundreds of thousands of people, has been established despite these handicaps.</p><p>In recommending revision and reduction, I therefore urge that action be taken with these facts in mind, to the end that an important and established industry may not be jeopardized.</p><p>The Tariff Board reports that no equitable method has been found to, levy purely specific duties on woolen and worsted fabrics and that, excepting for a compensatory duty, the rate must be ad valorem on such manufactures. It is important to realize, however, that no flat ad valorem rate on such fabrics can be made to work fairly and effectively. Any single rate which is high enough to equalize the difference in manufacturing cost at home and abroad on highly finished goods involving such labor would be prohibitory on cheaper goods, in which the labor cost is a smaller proportion of the total value. Conversely, a rate only adequate to equalize this difference on cheaper goods would remove protection from the fine-goods manufacture, the increase in which has been one of the striking features of the trade's development in recent years. I therefore recommend that in any revision the importance of a graduated scale of ad valorem duties on cloths be carefully considered and applied.</p><p>I venture to say that no legislative -body has ever had presented to it a more complete and exhaustive report than this on so difficult and complicated a subject as the relative costs of wool and woolens the world over. It is a monument to the thoroughness, industry, impartiality, and accuracy of the men engaged in its making. They were chosen from both political parties but have allowed no partisan spirit to prompt or control their inquiries. They are unanimous in their findings. I feel sure that after the report has been printed and studied the value of such a compendium of exact knowledge in respect to this schedule of the tariff will convince all of the wisdom of making such a board permanent in order that it may treat each schedule of the tariff as it has treated this, and then keep its bureau of information up to date with current changes in the economic world.</p><p>It is no part of the function of the Tariff Board to propose rates of duty. Their function is merely to present findings of fact on which rates of duty may be fairly determined in the light of adequate knowledge in accord with the economic policy to be followed. This is what the present report does.</p><p>The findings of fact by the board show ample reason for the revision downward of Schedule K, in accord with the protective principle, and present the data as to relative costs and prices from which may be determined what rates will fairly equalize the difference in production costs. I recommend that such revision be proceeded with at once.</p><p>PART IV. </p><p>[On the financial condition of the treasury, needed banking and currency reform, and departmental questions.] </p><p>THE WHITE HOUSE, December 21, 1911.</p><p>To the Senate and House of Representatives: </p><p>The financial condition of the Government, as shown at the close of the last fiscal year, June 30, 1911, was very satisfactory. The ordinary receipts into the general fund, excluding postal revenues, amounted to $701,372,374.99, and the disbursements from the general fund for current expenses and capital outlays, excluding postal and Panama Canal disbursements, including the interest on the public debt, amounted to $654,137,907-89, leaving a surplus Of $47,234,377.10.</p><p>The postal revenue receipts amounted to $237,879,823,60, while the payments made for the postal service from the postal revenues amounted to $237,660,705.48, which left a surplus of postal receipts over disbursements Of $219,118.12, the first time in 27 years in which a surplus occurred.</p><p>The interest-bearing debt of the United States June 30, 1911, amounted to $915,353,igo. The debt on which interest had ceased amounted to $1,879,830.26, and the debt bearing no interest, including greenbacks, national bank notes to be redeemed, and fractional currency, amounted to $386,751,917-43, or a total of interest and noninterest bearing debt amounting to $1,303,984,937.69.</p><p>The actual disbursements, exclusive of those for the Panama Canal and for the postal service for the year ending June 30, 1911, were $654,137,997.89. The actual disbursements for the year ending June 30, 1910, exclusive of the Panama Canal and the postal service disbursements, were $659,705,391.08, making a decrease Of $5,567,393.19 in yearly expenditures in the year 1911 under that of 1910. For the year ending June 30, 1912, the estimated receipts, exclusive of the postal revenues, are $666,000,000, while the total estimates, exclusive of those for the Panama Canal and the postal expenditures payable from the postal revenues, amount to $645,842,799.34. This is a decrease in the 1912 estimates from that of the 1911 estimates of $1,534,367-22.</p><p>For the year ending June 30, 1913, the estimated receipts, exclusive of the postal revenues, are $667,000,000, while the total estimated appropriations, exclusive of the Panama Canal and postal disbursements payable from postal revenues, will amount to $637,920,803.35. This is a decrease in the 1913 estimates from that of the 1912 estimates of $7,921,995.99.</p><p>As to the postal revenues, the expansion of the business in that department, the normal increase in the Post Office and the extension of the service, will increase the outlay to the SUM Of $260,938,463 ; but as the department was self-sustaining this year the Postmaster General is assured that next year the receipts will at least equal the expenditures, and probably exceed them by more than the surplus of this year. It is fair and equitable, therefore, in determining the economy with which the Government has been run, to exclude the transactions of a department like the Post Office Department, which relies for its support upon its receipts. In calculations heretofore made for comparison of economy in each year, it has been the proper custom only to include in the statement the deficit in the Post Office Department which was paid out of the Treasury.</p><p>A calculation of the actual increase in the expenses of Government arising from the increase in the population and the general expansion of governmental functions, except those of the Post Office, for a number of years shows a normal increase of about 4 per cent a year. By directing the exercise of great care to keep down the expenses and the estimates we have succeeded in reducing the total disbursements each year.</p><p>THE CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES. </p><p>The credit of this Government was shown to be better than that of any other Government by the sale of the Panama Canal 3 per cent bonds. These bonds did not give their owners the privilege of using them as a basis for bank-note circulation, nor was there any other privilege extended to them which would affect their general market value. Their sale, therefore, measured the credit of the Government. The premium which was realized upon the bonds made the actual interest rate of the transaction 2.909 per cent.</p><p>EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. </p><p>I In the Treasury Department the efficiency and economy work has been kept steadily up. Provision is made for the elimination of 134 positions during the coming year. Two hundred and sixty-seven statutory positions were eliminated during the last year in the office of the Treasury in Washington, and 141 positions in the year 1910, making an elimination Of 542 statutory positions since March 4, 1909; and this has been done without the discharge of anybody, because the normal resignations and deaths have been equal to the elimination of the places, a system of transfers having taken care of the persons whose positions were dropped out. In the field service if the department, too, 1,259 positions have been eliminated down to the present time, making a total net reduction of all Treasury positions to the number of 1,801. Meantime the efficiency of the work of the departmeat has increased.</p><p>MONETARY REFORM. </p><p>A matter of first importance that will come before Congress for action at this session is monetary reform. The Congress has itself arranged an early introduction of this great question through the report of its Monetary Commission. This commission was appointed to recommend a solution of the banking and currency problems so long confronting the Nation and to furnish the facts and data necessary to enable the Congress to take action. The commission was appointed when an impressive and urgent popular demand for legislative relief suddenly arose out of the distressing situation of the people caused by the deplorable panic of 1907. The Congress decided that while it could not give immediately the relief required, it would provide a commission to furnish the means for prompt action at a later date.</p><p>In order to do its work with thoroughness and precision this commission has taken some time to make its report. The country is undoubtedly hoping for as prompt action on the report as the convenience of the Congress can permit. The recognition of the gross imperfections and marked inadequacy of our banking and currency system even in our most quiet financial periods is of long standing; and later there has matured a recognition of the fact that our system is responsible for the extraordinary devastation, waste, and business paralysis of our recurring periods of panic. Though the members of the Monetary Commission have for a considerable time been working in the open, and while large numbers of the people have been openly working with them, and while the press has largely noted and discussed this work as it has proceeded, so that the report of the commission promises to represent a national movement, the details of the report are still being considered. I can not, therefore, do much more at this time than commend the immense importance of monetary reform, urge prompt consideration and action when the commission's report is received, and express my satisfaction that the plan to be proposed promises to embrace main features that, having met the approval of a great preponderance of the practical and professional opinion of the country, are likely to meet equal approval in Congress.</p><p>It is exceedingly fortunate that the wise and undisputed policy of maintaining unchanged the main features of our banking system rendered it at once impossible to introduce a central bank; for a central bank would certainly have been resisted, and a plan into which it could have been introduced would probably have been defeated. But as a central bank could not be a part of the only plan discussed or considered, that troublesome question is eliminated. And ingenious and novel as the proposed National Reserve Association appears, it simply is a logical outgrowth of what is best in our present system, and is, in fact, the fulfillment of that system.</p><p>Exactly how the management of that association should be organized is a question still open. It seems to be desirable that the banks which would own the association should in the main manage it, It will be an agency of the banks to act for them, and they can be trusted better than anybody else chiefly to conduct it. It is mainly bankers' work. But there must be some form of Government supervision and ultimate control, and I favor a reasonable representation of the Government in the management. I entertain no fear of the introduction of politics or of any undesirable influences from a properly measured Government representation.</p><p>I trust that all banks of the country possessing the requisite standards will be placed upon a footing of perfect equality of opportunity. Both the National system and the State system should be fairly recognized, leaving them eventually to coalesce if that shall prove to be their tendency. But such evolution can not develop impartially if the banks of one system are given or permitted any advantages of opportunity over those of the other system. And I trust also that the new legislation will carefully and completely protect and assure the individuality and the independence of each bank, to the end that any tendency there may ever be toward a consolidation of the money or banking power of the Nation shall be defeated.</p><p>It will always be possible, of course, to correct any features of the new law which may in practice prove to be unwise; so that while this law is sure to be enacted under conditions of unusual knowledge and authority, it also will include, it is well to remember, the possibility of future amendment.</p><p>With the present prospects of this long-awaited reform encouraging us, it would be singularly unfortunate if this monetary question should by any chance become a party issue. And I sincerely hope it will not. The exceeding amount of consideration it has received from the people of the Nation has been wholly nonpartisan; and the Congress set its nonpartisan seal upon it when the Monetary Commission was appointed. In commending the question to the favorable consideration of Congress, I speak for, and in the spirit of, the great number of my fellow citizens who without any thought of party or partisanship feel with remarkable earnestness that this reform is necessary to the interests of all the people.</p><p>THE WAR DEPARTMENT. </p><p>There is now before Congress a Dill, the purpose of which is to increase the efficiency and decrease the expense of the Army. It contains four principal features: First, a consolidation of the General Staff with the Adjutant General's and the Inspector General's Departments; second, a consolidation of the Quartermaster's Department with the Subsistence and the Pay Departments; third, the creation of an Army Service Corps; and fourth, an extension of the enlistment period from three to five years.</p><p>With the establishment of an Army Service Corps, as proposed in the bill, I am thoroughly in accord and am convinced that the establishment of such a corps will result in a material economy and a very great increase of efficiency in the Army. It has repeatedly been recommended by me and my predecessors. I also believe that a consolidation of the Staff Corps can be made with a resulting increase in efficiency and economy, but not along the lines provided in the bill under consideration.</p><p>I am opposed to any plan the result of which would be to break up or interfere with the essential principles of the detail system in the Staff Corps established by the act of February 2, 1901, and I am opposed to any plan the result of which would be to give to the officer selected as Chief of Staff or to any other member of the General Staff Corps greater permanency of office than he now has. Under the existing law neither the Chief. of Staff nor any other member of the General Staff Corps can remain in office for a period of more than four years, and there must be an interval of two years between successive tours of duty.</p><p>The bill referred to provides that certain persons shall become permanent members of the General Staff Corps, and that certain others are subject to redetail without an interval of two years. Such provision is fraught with danger to the welfare of the Army, and</p><p>would practically nullify the main purpose of the law creating the</p><p>In making the consolidations no reduction should be made in the total number of officers of the Army, of whom there are now too few to perform the duties imposed by law. I have in the past recommended an increase in the number of officers by 6oo in order to provide sufficient officers to perform all classes of staff duty and tc reduce the number of line officers detached from their commands. Congress at the last session increased the total number of officers by 2oo, but this is not enough. Promotion in the line of the Army is too slow. Officers do not attain command rank at an age early enough properly to exercise it. It would be a mistake further to retard this already slow promotion by throwing back into the line of the Arm a number of high-ranking officers to be absorbed as is rovided in the</p><p>Another feature of the bill which I believe to be a mistake is the proposed increase in the term of enlistment from three to five ears I believe it would be better to enlist men for six years, release them at the end of three years from active service, and put them in reserve for the remaining three years. Reenlistments should be largely confined to the noncommissioned officers and other enlisted men in the skilled grades. This plan by the payment of a comparatively small compensation during the three years of reserve, would keep a large bodv of men at the call of the Government, trained and ready for</p><p>The Army of the United States is in good condition. It showed itself able to meet an emergency in the successful mobilization of an army division of from i5,ooo to :2o,ooo men, which took place along the border of Mexico during the recent disturbances in that country. The marvelous freedom from the ordinary camp diseases of typhoid fever and measles is referred to in the report of the Secretary of War and shows such an effectiveness in the sanitary regulations and treatment of the Medical Corps, and in the discipline of the Army itself, as to invoke the highest commendation.</p><p>MEMORIAL AMPHITHEATER AT ARLINGTON. </p><p>I beg to renew my recommendation of last year that the Congress appropriate for a memorial amphitheater at Arlington, Va., the funds required to construct it upon the plans already approved.</p><p>THE PANAMA CANAL. </p><p>The very satisfactory progress made on the Panama Canal last year has continued, and there is every reason to believe that the canal</p><p>will be completed as early as the 1st of July, 1913, unless something unforeseen occurs. This is about 18 months before the time promised by the engineers.</p><p>We are now near enough the completion of the canal to make it imperatively necessary that legislation should be enacted to fix the method by which the canal shall be maintained and controlled and the zone governed. The fact is that to-day there is no statutory law by authority of which the President is maintaining the government of the zone. Such authority was given in an amendment to the Spooner Act, which expired by the terms of its own limitation some years ago. Since that time the government has continued, under the advice of the Attorney General that in the absence of action by Congress, there is necessarily an implied authority on the part of the Executive to maintain a government in a territory in which he has to see that the laws are executed. The fact that we have been able thus to get along during the important days of construction without legislation expressly formulating the government of the zone, or delegating the creation of it to the President, is not a reason for supposing that we may continue the same kind of a government after the construction is finished. The implied authority of the President to maintain a civil government in the zone may be derived from the mandatory direction given him in the original Spooner Act, by which he was commanded to build the canal; but certainly, now that the canal is about to be completed and to be put under a permanent management, there ought to be specific statutory authority for its regulation and control and for the government of the zone, which we hold for the chief and main purpose of operating the canal.</p><p>I fully concur with the Secretary of War that the problem is simply the management of a great public work, and not the government of a local republic; that every provision must be directed toward the successful maintenance of the canal as an avenue of commerce, and that all provisions for the government of those who live within the zone should be subordinate to the main purpose.</p><p>The zone is 40 miles long and 10 miles wide. Now, it has a population Of 50,000 or 60,000, but as soon as the work of construction is completed, the towns which make up this population will be deserted, and only comparatively few natives will continue their residence there. The control of them ought to approximate a military government. One judge and two justices of the peace will be sufficient to attend to all the judicial and litigated business there is. With a few fundamental laws of Congress, the zone should be governed by the orders of the President, issued through the War Department, as it is today. Provisions can be made for the guaranties of life, liberty, and property, but beyond those, the government should be that of a military reservation, managed in connection with this great highway of trade.</p><p>FURNISHING SUPPLIES AND REPAIRS. </p><p>In my last annual message I discussed at length the reasons for the Government's assuming the task of furnishing to all ships that use the canal, whether our own naval vessels or others, the supplies of coal and oil and other necessities with which they must be replenished either before or after passing through the canal, together with the dock facilities and repairs of every character. This it is thought wise to do through the Government, because the Government must establish for itself, for its own naval vessels, large depots and dry docks and warehouses, and these may easily be enlarged so as to secure to the world public using the canal reasonable prices and a certainty that there will be no discrimination between those who wish to avail themselves of such facilities.</p><p>TOLLS .</p><p>I renew my recommendation with respect to the tolls of the canal that within limits, which shall seem wise to Congress, the power of fixing tolls be given to the President. In order to arrive at a proper conclusion, there must be some experimenting, and this can not be done if Congress does not delegate the power to one who can act expeditiously.</p><p>POWER EXISTS TO RELIEVE AMERICAN SHIPPING. </p><p>I am very confident that the United States has the power to relieve from the payment of tolls any part of our shipping that Congress deems wise. We own the canal. It was our money that built it. We have the right to charge tolls for its use. Those tolls must be the same to everyone; but when we are dealing with our own ships, the practice of many Governments of subsidizing their own merchant vessels is so well established in general that a subsidy equal to the tolls, an equivalent remission of tolls, can not be held to be a discrimination in the use of the canal. The practice in the Suez Canal makes this clear. The experiment in tolls to be made by the President would doubtless disclose how great a burden of tolls the coastwise trade between the Atlantic and the Pacific coast could bear without preventing its usefulness in competition with the transcontinental railroads. One of the chief reasons for building the canal was to set up this competition and to bring the two shores closer together as a practical trade problem. It may be that the tolls will have to be wholly remitted. I do not think this is the best principle, because I believe that the cost of such a Government work as the Panama Canal ought to be imposed gradually but certainly upon the trade which it creates and makes possible. So far as we can, consistent with the development of the world's trade through the canal, and the benefit which it was intended to secure to the east and west coastwise trade, we ought to labor to secure from the canal tolls a sufficient amount ultimately to meet the debt which we have assumed and to pay the interest.</p><p>THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. </p><p>In respect to the Philippines, I urgently join in the recommendation of the Secretary of War that the act of February 6, 1905, limiting the indebtedness that may be incurred by the Philippine Government for the construction of public works, be increased from $5,000,000 to $15,ooo,ooo. The finances of that Government are in excellent condition. The maximum sum mentioned is quite low as compared with the amount of indebtedness of other governments with similar resources, and the success which has attended the expenditure of the $5,000,000 in the useful improvements of the harbors and other places in the Islands justifies and requires additional expenditures for like purposes.</p><p>NATURALIZATION .</p><p>I also join in the recommendation that the legislature of the Philippine Islands be authorized to provide for the naturalization of Filipinos and others who by the present law are treated as aliens, so as to enable them to become citizens of the Philippine Islands.</p><p>FRIARS' LANDS. </p><p>Pending an investigation by Congress at its last session, through one of its committees, into the disposition of the friars' lands, Secretary Dickinson directed that the friars' lands should not be sold in excess of the limits fixed for the public lands until Congress should pass upon the subject or should have concluded its investigation. This order has been an obstruction to the disposition of the lands, and I expect to direct the Secretary of War to return to the practice under the opinion of the Attorney General which will enable us to dispose of the lands much more promptly, and to prepare a sinking fund with which to meet the $7,000,000 of bonds issued for the purchase of the lands. I have no doubt whatever that the Attorney General's construction was a proper one, and that it is in the interest of everyone that the land shall be promptly disposed of. The danger of creating a monopoly of ownership in lands under the statutes as construed is nothing. There are only two tracts of 60,000 acres each unimproved and in remote Provinces that are likely to be disposed of in bulk, and the rest of the lands are subject to the limitation that they shall be first offered to the present tenants and lessors who hold them in small tracts.</p><p>RIVERS AND HARBORS. </p><p>The estimates for the river and harbor improvements reach $32,000,000 for the coming year. I wish to urge that whenever a project has been adopted by Congress as one to be completed, the more money which can be economically expended in its construction in each year, the greater the ultimate economy. This has especial application to the improvement of the Mississippi River and its large branches. It seems to me that an increase in the amount- of money now being annually expended in the improvement of the Ohio River which has been formally adopted by Congress would be in the interest of the public. A similar change ought to be made during the present Congress, in the amount to be appropriated for the Missouri River. The engineers say that the cost of the improvement of the Missouri River from Kansas City to St. Louis, in order to secure 6 feet as a permanent channel, will reach $20,000,000. There have been at least three recommendations from the Chief of Engineers that if the improvement be adopted, $2,000,000 should be expended upon it annually. This particular improvement is especially entitled to the attention of Congress, because a company has been organized in Kansas City, with a capital of $1,000,000, which has built steamers and barges, and is actually using the river for transportation in order to show what can be done in the way of affecting rates between Kansas City and St. Louis, and in order to manifest their good faith and confidence in respect of the improvement. I urgently recommend that the appropriation for this improvement be increased from $600,000, as recommended now in the completion of a contract, to $2,000,000 annually, so that the work may be done in 10 years.</p><p>WATERWAY FROM THE LAKES TO THE GULF. </p><p>The project for a navigable waterway from Lake Michigan to the mouth of the Illinois River, and thence via the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, is one of national importance. In view of the work already accomplished by the Sanitary District of Chicago, an agency of the State of Illinois, which has constructed the most difficult and costly stretch of this waterway and made it an asset of the Nation, and in view of the fact that the people of Illinois have authorized the expenditure Of $20,000,000 to carry this waterway 62 miles farther to Utica, I feel that it is fitting that this work should be supplemented by the Government, and that the expenditures recommended by the special board of engineers on the waterway from Utica to the mouth of the Illinois River be made upon lines which while providing a waterway for the Nation should otherwise benefit that State to the fullest extent. I recommend that the term of service of said special board of engineers be continued, and that it be empowered to reopen the question of the treatment of the lower Illinois River, and to negotiate with a properly constituted commission representing the State of Illinois, and to agree upon a plan for the improvement of the lower Illinois River and upon the extent to which the United States may properly cooperate with the State of Illinois in securing the construction of a navigable waterway from Lockport to the mouth of the Illinois River in conjunction with the development of water power by that State between Lockport and Utica.</p><p>THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. </p><p>Removal of clerks of Federal courts. </p><p>The report of the Attorney General shows that he has subjected to close examination the accounts of the clerks of the Federal courts; that he has found a good many which disclose irregularities or dishonesty; but that he has had considerable difficulty in securing an effective prosecution or removal of the clerks thus derelict. I am certainly not unduly prejudiced against the Federal courts, but the fact is that the long and confidential relations which grow out of the tenure for life on the part of the judge and the practical tenure for life on the part of the clerk are not calculated to secure the strictness of dealing by the judge with the clerk in respect to his fees and accounts which assures in the clerk's conduct a freedom from overcharges and carelessness. The relationship between the judge and the clerk makes it ungracious for members of the bar to complain of the clerk or for department examiners to make charges against him to be heard by the court, and an order of removal of a clerk and a judgment for the recovery of fees are in some cases reluctantly entered by the judge. For this reason I recommend an amendment to the law whereby the President shall be given power to remove the clerks for cause. This provision need not interfere with the right of the judge to appoint his clerk or to remove him.</p><p>French spoliation awards. </p><p>In my last message, I recommended to Congress that it authorize the payment of the findings or judgments of the Court of Claims in the matter of the French spoliation cases. There has been no appropriation to pay these judgments since 1905. The findings and awards were obtained after a very bitter fight, the Government succeeding in about 75 per cent of the cases. The amount of the awards ought, as a matter of good faith on the part of the Government, to be paid.</p><p>E MPLOYERS' LIABILITY AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION. </p><p>The limitation of the liability of the master to his servant for personal injuries to such as are occasioned by his fault has been abandoned in most civilized countries and provision made whereby the employee injured in the course of his employment is compensated for his loss of working ability irrespective of negligence. The principle upon which such provision proceeds is that accidental injuries to workmen in modern industry, with its vast complexity and inherent dangers arising from complicated machinery and the use of the great forces of steam and electricity, should be regarded as risks of the industry and the loss borne in some equitable proportion by those who for their own profit engage therein. In recognition of this the last Congress authorized the appointment of a commission to investigate the subject of employers' liability and workmen's compensation and to report the result of their investigations, through the President, to Congress. This commission was appointed and has been at work, holding hearings, gathering data, and considering the subject, and it is expected will be able to report by the first of the year, in accordance with the provisions of the law. It is hoped and expected that the commission will suggest legislation which will enable us to put in the place of the present wasteful and sometimes unjust system of employers' liability a plan of compensation which will afford some certain and definite relief to all employees who are injured in the course of their employment in those industries which are subject to the regulating power of Congress.</p><p>MEASURES TO PREVENT DELAY AND UNNECESSARY COST OF LITIGATION. </p><p>In promotion of the movement for the prevention of delay and unnecessary cost, in litigation, I am glad to say that the Supreme Court has taken steps to reform the present equity rules of the Federal courts, and that we may in the near future expect a revision of them which will be a long step in the right direction.</p><p>The American Bar Association has recommended to Congress several bills expediting procedure, one of which has already passed the House unanimously, February 6, 1911. This directs that no judgment should be set aside or reversed, or new trial granted, unless it appears to the court, after an examination of the entire cause, that the error complained of has injuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties, and also provides for the submission of issues of fact to a jury, reserving questions of law for subsequent argument and decision. I hope this bill will pass the Senate and become law, for it will simplify the procedure at law.</p><p>Another bill to amend chapter II of the judicial Code, in order to avoid errors in pleading, was presented by the same association, and one. enlarging the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court so as to permit that court to examine, upon a writ of error, all cases in which any right or title is claimed under the Constitution, or any statute or treaty of the United States, whether the decision in the court below has been against the right or title or in its favor. Both these measures are in the interest of justice and should be passed.</p><p>POST OFFICE. </p><p>At the beginning of the present administration in 1909 the postal service was in arrears to the extent Of $17,479,770.47. It was very much the largest deficit on record. In the brief space of two years this has been turned into a surplus Of $220,000, which has been accomplished without curtailment of the postal facilities, as may be seen by the fact that there have been established 3,744 new post offices; delivery by carrier has been added to the service in 186 cities; 2,516 new rural routes have been established, covering 60,000 miles; the force of postal employees has been increased in these two years by more than 8,000, and their average annual salary has had a substantial increase.</p><p>POSTAL-SAVINGS SYSTEM. </p><p>On January 3, 1911, postal-savings depositories were established experimentally in 48 States and Territories. After three months' successful operation the system was extended as rapidly as feasible to the 7,500 Post offices of the first, second, and third classes constituting the presidential grade. By the end of the year practically all of these will have been designated and then the system will be extended to all fourth-class post offices doing a money-order business.</p><p>In selecting post offices for depositories consideration was given to the efficiency of the postmasters and only those offices where the ratings were satisfactory to the department have been designated. Withholding designation from postmasters with unsatisfactory ratings has had a salutary effect on the service.</p><p>The deposits have kept pace with the extension of the system. Amounting to only $60,652 at the end of the first month's operation in the experimental offices, they increased to $679,310 by July, and now after 11 months of operation have reached a total of $ 11,000,000. This sum is distributed among 2,71o banks and protected tinder the law by bonds deposited with the Treasurer of the United States.</p><p>Under the method adopted for the conduct of the system certificates are issued as evidence of deposits, and accounts with depositors are kept by the post offices instead of by the department. Compared with the practice in other countries of entering deposits in pass books and keeping at the central office a ledger account with each depositor, the use of the certificate has resulted in great economy of administration.</p><p>The depositors thus far number approximately 150,000. They include 40 nationalities, native Americans largely predominating and English and Italians coming next.</p><p>The first conversion of deposits into United States bonds bearing interest at the rate of 2.5 per cent occurred on July 1, 1911, the amount of deposits exchanged being $41,900, or a little more than 6 per cent of the total outstanding certificates of deposit on June 30. Of this issue, bonds to the value of $6,120 were in coupon form and $35,780 in registered form.</p><p>PARCEL POST. </p><p>Steps should be taken immediately for the establishment of a rural parcel post. In the estimates of appropriations needed for the maintenance of the postal service for the ensuing fiscal year an item of $150,000 has been inserted to cover the preliminary expense of establishing a parcel post on rural mail routes, as well as to cover an investigation having for its object the final establishment of a general parcel post on all railway and steamboat transportation routes. The department believes that after the initial expenses of establishing the system are defrayed and the parcel post is in full operation on the rural routes it will not only bring in sufficient revenue to meet its cost, but also a surplus that can be utilized in paying the expenses of a parcel post in the City Delivery Service.</p><p>It is hoped that Congress will authorize the immediate establishment of a limited parcel post on such rural routes as may be selected, providing for the delivery along the routes of parcels not exceeding eleven pounds, which is the weight limit for the international parcel post, or at the post office from which such route emanates, or on another route emanating from the same office. Such preliminary service will prepare the way for the more thorough and comprehensive inquiry contemplated in asking for the appropriation mentioned, enable the department to gain definite information concerning the practical operation of a general system, and at the same time extend the benefit of the service to a class of people who, above all others, are specially in need of it.</p><p>The suggestion that we have a general parcel post has awakened great opposition on the part of some who think that it will have the effect to destroy the business of the country storekeeper. Instead of doing this, I think the change will greatly increase business for the benefit of all. The reduction in the cost of living it will bring about ought to make its coming certain.</p><p>THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. </p><p>On the 2d of November last, I reviewed the fighting fleet of battleships and other vessels assembled in New York Harbor, consisting of 24 battleships, 2 armored cruisers, 2 cruisers, 22 destroyers, 12 torpedo boats, 8 submarines, and other attendant vessels, making 98 vessels of all classes, of a tonnage Of 576,634 tons. Those who saw the fleet were struck with its preparedness and with its high military efficiency. All Americans should be proud of its personnel.</p><p>The fleet was deficient in the number of torpedo destroyers, in cruisers, and in colliers, as well as in large battleship cruisers, which are now becoming a very important feature of foreign navies, notably the British, German, and Japanese.</p><p>The building plan for this year contemplates two battleships and two colliers. This is because the other and smaller vessels can be built much more rapidly in case of emergency than the battleships, and we certainly ought to continue the policy of two battleships a year until after the Panama Canal is finished and until in our first line and in our reserve line we can number 40 available vessels of proper armament and size.</p><p>The reorganization of the Navy and the appointment of four aids to the Secretary have continued to demonstrate their usefulness. It would be difficult now to administer the affairs of the Navy without the expert counsel and advice of these aids, and I renew the recommendation which I made last year, that the aids be recognized by statute.</p><p>It is certain that the Navy, with its present size, should have admirals in active command higher than rear admirals. The recognized grades in order are: Admiral of the fleet, admiral, vice admiral, and rear admiral. Our great battleship fleet is commanded by a rear admiral, with four other rear admirals under his orders. This is not as it should be, and when questions of precedence arise between our naval officers and those of European navies, the American rear admiral, though in command of ten times the force of a foreign vice admiral, must yield precedence to the latter. Such an absurdity ought not to prevail, and it can be avoided by the creation of two or three positions of flag rank above that of rear admiral.</p><p>I attended the opening of the new training school at North Chicago, Ill., and am glad to note the opportunity which this gives for drawing upon young men of the country from the interior, from farms, stores, shops, and offices, which insures a high average of intelligence and character among them, and which they showed in the very wonderful improvement in discipline and drill which only a few short weeks' presence at the naval station had made.</p><p>I invite your attention to the consideration of the new system of detention and of punishment for Army and Navy enlisted men which has obtained in Great Britain, and which has made greatly for the better control of the. men. We should adopt a similar system here.</p><p>Like the Treasury Department and the War Department, the Navy Department has given much attention to economy in administration, and has cut down a number of unnecessary expenses and reduced its estimates except for construction and the increase that that involves.</p><p>I urge upon Congress the necessity for an immediate increase of 2,000 men in the enlisted strength of the Navy, provided for in the estimates. Four thousand more are now needed to man all the available vessels.</p><p>There are in the service to-day about 47,750 enlisted men of all ratings.</p><p>Careful computation shows that in April, 1912, 49,166 men will be required for vessels in commission, and 3,000 apprentice seamen should be kept under training at all times.</p><p>ABOLITION OF NAVY YARDS. </p><p>The Secretary of the Navy has recommended the abolition of certain of the smaller and unnecessary navy yards, and in order to furnish a complete and comprehensive report has referred the question of all navy yards to the joint board of the Army and Navy. This board will shortly make its report and the Secretary of the Navy advises me that his recommendations on the subject will be presented early in the coming year. The measure of economy contained in a proper handling of this subject is so great and so important to the interests of the Nation that I shall present it to Congress as a separate subject apart from my annual message. Concentration of the necessary work for naval vessels in a few navy yards on each coast is a vital necessity if proper economy in Government expenditures is to be attained.</p><p>AMALGAMATION OF STAFF CORPS IN THE NAVY. </p><p>The Secretary of the Navy is striving to unify the various corps of the Navy to the extent possible and thereby stimulate a Navy spirit as distinguished from a corps spirit. In this he has my warm support.</p><p>All officers are to be naval officers first and specialists afterwards. This means that officers will take up at least one specialty, such as ordnance, construction, or engineering. This is practically what is done now, only some of the specialists, like the pay officers and naval constructors, are not of the line. It is proposed to make them all of the line.</p><p>All combatant corps should obviously be of the line. This necessitates amalgamating the pay officers and also those engaged in the technical work of producing the finished ship. This is at present the case with the single exception of the naval constructors, whom it is now proposed to amalgamate with the line.</p><p>COUNCIL OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. </p><p>I urge again upon Congress the desirability of establishing the council of national defense. The bill to establish this council was before Congress last winter, and it is hoped that this legislation will pass during the present session. The purpose of the council is to determine the general policy of national defense and to recommend to Congress and to the President such measures relating to it as it shall deem necessary and expedient.</p><p>No such machinery is now provided by which the readiness of the Army and Navy may be improved and the programs of military and naval requirements shall be coordinated and properly scrutinized with a view of the necessities of the whole Nation rather than of separate departments.</p><p>DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE AND LABOR. </p><p>For the consideration of matters which are pending or have been disposed of in the Agricultural Department and in the Department of Commerce and Labor, I refer to the very excellent reports of the Secretaries of those departments. I shall not be able to submit to Congress until after the Christmas holidays the question of conservation of our resources arising in Alaska and the West and the question of the rate for second-class mail matter in the Post Office Department.</p><p>COMMISSION ON EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY. </p><p>The law does not require the submission of the reports of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency until the 31st of December. I shall therefore not be able to submit a report of the work of that commission until the assembling of Congress after the holidays.</p><p>CIVIL RETIREMENT AND CONTRIBUTORY PENSION SYSTEM. </p><p>I have already advocated, in my last annual message, the adoption of a civil-service retirement system, with a contributory feature to it so as to reduce to a minimum the cost to the Government of the pensions to be paid. After considerable reflection, I am very much opposed to a pension system that involves no contribution from the employees. I think the experience of other governments justifies this view; but the crying necessity for some such contributory system, with possibly a preliminary governmental outlay, in order to cover the initial cost and to set the system going at once while the contributions are accumulating, is manifest on every side. Nothing will so much promote the economy and efficiency of the Government as such a system.</p><p>ELIMINATION OF ALL LOCAL OFFICES FROM POLITICS. </p><p>I wish to renew again my recommendation that all the local offices throughout the country, including collectors of internal revenue, collectors of customs, postmasters of all four classes, immigration commissioners and marshals, should be by law covered into the classified service, the necessity for confirmation by the Senate be removed, and the President and the others, whose time is now taken up in distributing this patronage under the custom that has prevailed since the beginning of the Government in accordance with the recommendation of the Senators and Congressmen of the majority party, should be relieved from this burden. I am confident that such a change would greatly reduce the cost of administering the Government, and that it would add greatly to its efficiency. It would take away the power to use the patronage of the Government for political purposes. When officers are recommended by Senators and Congressmen from political motives and for political services rendered, it is impossible to expect that while in office the appointees will not regard their tenure as more or less dependent upon continued political service for their patrons, and no regulations, however stiff or rigid, will prevent this, because such regulations, in view of the method and motive for selection, are plainly inconsistent and deemed hardly worthy of respect.</p>^

Harding^	^speech-3804^	^spe_1921_1206_harding^	^noTypes^	^noNames^	^National Archives^	^First Annual Message^	^^	^<p>It is a very gratifying privilege to come to the Congress with the Republic at peace with all the nations of the world. More, it is equally gratifying to report that our country is not only free from every impending, menace of war, but there are growing assurances of the permanency of the peace which we so deeply cherish.<br /> <br /> For approximately ten years we have dwelt amid menaces of war or as participants in war's actualities, and the inevitable aftermath, with its disordered conditions, bits added to the difficulties of government which adequately can not be appraised except by, those who are in immediate contact and know the responsibilities. Our tasks would be less difficult if we had only ourselves to consider, but so much of the world was involved, the disordered conditions are so well-nigh universal, even among nations not engaged in actual warfare, that no permanent readjustments can be effected without consideration of our inescapable relationship to world affairs in finance and trade. Indeed, we should be unworthy of our best traditions if we were unmindful of social, moral, and political conditions which are not of direct concern to us, but which do appeal to the human sympathies and the very becoming interest of a people blest with our national good fortune.<br /> <br /> It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration. In the main such a program must be worked out by the nations more directly concerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic remedies for the menacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly because there is compensation in the consciousness of assisting, selfishly because the commerce and international exchanges in trade, which marked our high tide of fortunate advancement, are possible only when the nations of all continents are restored to stable order and normal relationship.<br /> <br /> In the main the contribution of this Republic to restored normalcy in the world must come through the initiative of the executive branch of the Government, but the best of intentions and most carefully considered purposes would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of Congress were not cheerfully accorded.<br /> <br /> I am very sure we shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutional duties or authority. During the anxieties of war, when necessity seemed compelling there were excessive grants of authority and all extraordinary concentration of powers in the Chief Executive. The repeal of war-time legislation and the automatic expirations which attended the peace proclamations have put an end to these emergency excesses but I have the wish to go further than that. I want to join you in restoring, in the most cordial way, the spirit of coordination and cooperation, and that mutuality of confidence and respect which is necessary ill representative popular government.<br /> <br /> Encroachment upon the functions of Congress or attempted dictation of its policy are not to be thought of, much less attempted, but there is all insistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed the solution of the difficult problems confronting both the legislative and executive branches of the Government.<br /> <br /> It is worth while to make allusion here to the character of our Government, mindful as one must be that an address to you is no less a message to all our people, for whom you speak most intimately. Ours is it popular Government through political parties. We divide along political lines, and I would ever have it so. I do not mean that partisan preferences should hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and patriotic official duty. We saw partisan lines utterly obliterated when war imperiled, and our faith in the Republic was riveted anew. We ought not to find these partisan lines obstructing the expeditious solution of the urgent problems of peace.<br /> <br /> Granting that we are fundamentally a representative popular Government, with political parties the governing agencies, I believe the political party in power should assume responsibility, determine upon policies ill the conference which supplements conventions and election campaigns, and then strive for achievement through adherence to the accepted policy.<br /> <br /> There is vastly greater security, immensely more of the national viewpoint, much larger and prompter accomplishment where our divisions are along party lines, in the broader and loftier sense, than to divide geographically, or according to pursuits, or personal following. For a century and a third, parties have been charged with responsibility and held to strict accounting. When they fail, they are relieved of authority; and the system has brought its to a national eminence no less than a world example.<br /> <br /> Necessarily legislation is a matter of compromise. The full ideal is seldom attained. In that meeting of minds necessary to insure results, there must and will be accommodations and compromises, but in the estimate of convictions and sincere purposes the supreme responsibility to national interest must not be ignored. The shield to the high-minded public servant who adheres to party policy is manifest, but the higher purpose is the good of the Republic as a whole.<br /> <br /> It would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really large volume and excellent quality of work accomplished by the extraordinary session of Congress which so recently adjourned. I am not unmindful of the very difficult tasks with which you were called to deal, and no one can ignore the insistent conditions which, during recent years, have called for the continued and almost exclusive attention of your membership to public work. It would suggest insincerity if I expressed complete accord with every expression recorded in your roll calls, but we are all agreed about the difficulties and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seeking the reduction, amelioration and readjustment of the burdens of taxation. Later on, when other problems are solved, I shall make some recommendations about renewed consideration of our tax program, but for the immediate time before us we must be content with the billion dollar reduction in the tax draft upon the people, and diminished irritations, banished uncertainty and improved methods of collection. By your sustainment of the rigid economies already inaugurated, with hoped-for extension of these economies and added efficiencies in administration, I believe further reductions may be enacted and hindering burdens abolished.<br /> <br /> In these urgent economies we shall be immensely assisted by the budget system for which you made provision in the extraordinary session. The first budget is before you. Its preparation is a signal achievement, and the perfection of the system, a thing impossible in the few months available for its initial trial, will mark its enactment as the beginning of the greatest reformation in governmental practices since the beginning of the Republic.<br /> <br /> There is pending a grant of authority to the administrative branch of the Government for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loans growing out of our grant of war credits. With the hands of the executive branch held impotent to deal with these debts we are hindering urgent readjustments among our debtors and accomplishing nothing for ourselves. I think it is fair for the Congress to assume that the executive branch of the Government would adopt no major policy in dealing with these matters which would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans, certainly not without asking congressional approval, but there are minor problems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguarding of our interests which can not even be attempted without this authorization. It will be helpful to ourselves and it will improve conditions among our debtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may be negotiated.<br /> <br /> The previous Congress, deeply concerned in behalf of our merchant marine, in 1920 enacted the existing shipping law, designed for the upbuilding of the American merchant marine. Among other things provided to encourage our shipping on the world's seas, the Executive was directed to give notice of the termination of all existing commercial treaties in order to admit of reduced duties on imports carried in American bottoms. During the life of the act no Executive has complied with this order of the Congress. When the present administration came into responsibility it began an early inquiry into the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones Act. Only one conclusion has been possible. Frankly, Members of House and Senate, eager as I am to join you in the making of an American merchant marine commensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of out-commercial treaties would involve us in a chaos of trade relationships and add indescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world. Our power to do so is not disputed, but power and ships, without comity of relationship, will not give us the expanded trade which is inseparably linked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction of duty, for which the treaty denouncements were necessary, encouraged only the carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which unfurls the flag on the seas is both free and dutiable, and the cargoes which make it nation eminent in trade are outgoing, rather than incoming.<br /> <br /> It is not my thought to lay the problem before you in detail today. It is desired only to say to you that the executive branch of the Government, uninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made, is well convinced that your proposal, highly intended and heartily supported here, is so fraught with difficulties and so marked by tendencies to discourage trade expansion, that I invite your tolerance of noncompliance for only a few weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft upon the Public Treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer it to-day, gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine, that it will argue its own approval. It is enough to say to-day that we are so possessed of ships, and the American intention to establish it merchant marine is so unalterable, that a plain of reimbursement, at no other cost than is contemplated in the existing act, will appeal to the pride and encourage the hope of all the American people.<br /> <br /> There is before you the completion of the enactment of what has been termed a "permanent" tariff law, the word "permanent" being used to distinguish it from the emergency act which the Congress expedited early in the extraordinary session, and which is the law today. I can not too strongly urge in early completion of this necessary legislation. It is needed to stabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite our trade relations abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many of our own industries which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of our Nation.<br /> <br /> There is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting opinion about any tariff revision. We can not go far wrong when we base our tariffs on the policy of preserving the productive activities which enhance employment and add to our national prosperity.<br /> <br /> Again comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world conditions, that peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilitation and that we can not dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do the just thing in aiding world reconstruction and readjustment. We do not seek a selfish aloofness, and we could not profit by it, were it possible. We recognize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanency of trade lies in its acceptable exchanges. In our pursuit of markets we must give as well as receive. We can not sell to others who do not produce, nor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of every obligation of humanity, commerce and finance, linked as they are in the present world condition, it is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to be helpful to others. With all my heart I wish restoration to the peoples blighted by the awful World War, but the process of restoration does not lie in our acceptance of like conditions. It were better to remain on firm ground, strive for ample employment and high standards of wage at home, and point the way to balanced budgets, rigid economies, and resolute, efficient work as the necessary remedies to cure disaster.<br /> <br /> Everything relating to trade, among ourselves and among nations, has been expanded, excessive, inflated, abnormal, and there is a madness in finance which no American policy alone will cure. We are a creditor Nation, not by normal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfishness to seek to save ourselves, when the processes of that salvation are not only not denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine for others no industry by which they subsist; we are obligated to permit the undermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintained activities.<br /> <br /> Every contemplation, it little matters in which direction one turns, magnifies the difficulty of tariff legislation, but the necessity of the revision is magnified with it. Doubtless we are justified in seeking .1 More flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will be found to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted to meet unusual and changing conditions which can not be accurately anticipated. There are problems incident to unfair practices, and to exchanges which madness in money have made almost unsolvable. I know of no manner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the powers of the Tariff Commission so that it can adapt itself to it scientific and wholly just administration of the law.<br /> <br /> I am not unmindful of the constitutional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to the Chief Executive, who could proclaim additional duties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate.<br /> <br /> At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the Executive's powers or add to the responsibilities of the office. They are already too large. If there were any other plan I would prefer it.<br /> <br /> The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the Tariff Commission into new and enlarged activities, because no Executive could discharge such a duty except upon the information acquired and recommendations made by this commission. But the plan is feasible, and the proper functioning of the board would give its it better administration of a defined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribed without flexibility.<br /> <br /> There is a manifest difference of opinion about the merits of American valuation. Many nations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis for collecting duties; that is, they take the cost of the imports delivered at the port of entry as the basis for levying duty. It is no radical departure, in view of varying conditions and the disordered state of money values, to provide for American valuation, but there can not be ignored the danger of such a valuation, brought to the level of our own production costs, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do so in many instances where imports ought to be encouraged. I believe Congress ought well consider the desirability of the only promising alternative, namely, a provision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribed conditions, on any given list of articles imported.<br /> <br /> In this proposed flexibility, authorizing increases to meet conditions so likely to change, there should also be provision for decreases. A rate may be just to-day, and entirely out of proportion six months from to-day. If our tariffs are to be made equitable, and not necessarily burden our imports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessary for years to come. Knowing the impossibility of modification by act of Congress for any one or a score of lines without involving a long array of schedules, I think we shall go a long ways toward stabilization, if there is recognition of the Tariff Commission's fitness to recommend urgent changes by proclamation.<br /> <br /> I am sure about public opinion favoring the early determination of our tariff policy. There have been reassuring signs of a business revival from the deep slump which all the world has been experiencing. Our unemployment, which gave its deep concern only a few weeks ago, has grown encouragingly less, and new assurances and renewed confidence will attend the congressional declaration that American industry will be held secure.<br /> <br /> Much has been said about the protective policy for ourselves making it impossible for our debtors to discharge their obligations to us. This is a contention not now pressing for decision. If we must choose between a people in idleness pressing for the payment of indebtedness, or a people resuming the normal ways of employment and carrying the credit, let us choose the latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human ill most vivid in our minds. We have been giving, and are giving now, of our influence and appeals to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crushing burdens of armament. It is all very earnest, with a national soul impelling. But a people unemployed, and gaunt with hunger, face a situation quite as disheartening as war, and our greater obligation to-day is to do the Government's part toward resuming productivity and promoting fortunate and remunerative employment.<br /> <br /> Something more than tariff protection is required by American agriculture. To the farmer has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment. There is actual depression in our agricultural industry, while agricultural prosperity is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the country.<br /> <br /> Congress has sought very earnestly to provide relief. It has promptly given such temporary relief as has been possible, but the call is insistent for the permanent solution. It is inevitable that large crops lower the prices and short crops advance them. No legislation can cure that fundamental law. But there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in returns for agricultural production.<br /> <br /> It is rather shocking to be told, and to have the statement strongly supported, that 9,000,000 bales of cotton, raised on American plantations in a given year, will actually be worth more to the producers than 13,000,000 bales would have been. Equally shocking is the statement that 700,000,000 bushels of wheat, raised by American farmers, would bring them more money than a billion bushels. Yet these are not exaggerated statements. In a world where there are tens of millions who need food and clothing which they can not get, such a condition is sure to indict the social system which makes it possible.<br /> <br /> In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper encouragement should be given to the cooperative marketing programs. These have proven very helpful to the cooperating communities in Europe. In Russia the cooperative community has become the recognized bulwark of law and order, and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis. Ultimately they will be accredited with the salvation of the Russian State.<br /> <br /> There is the appeal for this experiment. Why not try it? No one challenges the right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumer's pay for his product, no one disputes that we can not live without the farmer. He is justified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fair return for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid; and given assurance that his labors shall not be in vain, we reassure all the people of a production sufficient to meet our National requirement and guard against disaster.<br /> <br /> The base of the pyramid of civilization which rests upon the soil is shrinking through the drift of population from farm to city. For a generation we have been expressing more or less concern about this tendency. Economists have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thought for at time that modern conveniences and the more intimate contact would halt the movement, but it has gone steadily on. Perhaps only grim necessity will correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy.<br /> <br /> The existing scheme of adjusting freight rates has been favoring the basing points, until industries are attracted to some centers and repelled from others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation has attended, and the cost increased accordingly. The grain-milling and meat-packing industries afford ample illustration, and the attending concentration is readily apparent. The menaces in concentration are not limited to the retardingly influences on agriculture. Manifestly the conditions and terms of railway transportation ought not be permitted to increase this undesirable tendency. We have a just pride in our great cities, but we shall find a greater pride in the Nation, which has it larger distribution of its population into the country, where comparatively self-sufficient smaller communities may blend agricultural and manufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and enhanced good fortune. Such a movement contemplates no destruction of things wrought, of investments made, or wealth involved. It only looks to a general policy of transportation of distributed industry, and of highway construction, to encourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balance between city and country. The problem may well have your earnest attention.<br /> <br /> It has been perhaps the proudest claim of our American civilization that in dealing with human relationships it has constantly moved toward such justice in distributing the product of human energy that it has improved continuously the economic status of the mass of people. Ours has been a highly productive social organization. On the way up from the elemental stages of society we have eliminated slavery and serfdom and are now far on the way to the elimination of poverty.<br /> <br /> Through the eradication of illiteracy and the diffussion of education mankind has reached a stage where we may fairly say that in the United States equality of opportunity has been attained, though all are not prepared to embrace it. There is, indeed, a too great divergence between the economic conditions of the most and the least favored classes in the community. But even that divergence has now come to the point where we bracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate classes. Our efforts may well be directed to improving the status of both.<br /> <br /> While this set of problems is commonly comprehended under the general phrase "Capital and Labor," it is really vastly broader. It is a question of social and economic organization. Labor has become a large contributor, through its savings, to the stock of capital; while the people who own the largest individual aggregates of capital are themselves often hard and earnest laborers. Very often it is extremely difficult to draw the line of demarcation between the two groups; to determine whether a particular individual is entitled to be set down as laborer or as capitalist. In a very large proportion of cases he is both, and when he is both he is the most useful citizen.<br /> <br /> The right of labor to organize is just as fundamental and necessary as is the right of capital to organize. The right of labor to negotiate, to deal with and solve its particular problems in an organized way, through its chosen agents, is just as essential as is the right of capital to organize, to maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed, we have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as a member of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation of liability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit. Along this line of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress toward solution of our problem of capital and labor.<br /> <br /> In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limited liability of stockholders, particularly when engaged in in the public service, it is recognized that the outside public has a large concern which must be protected; and so we provide regulations, restrictions, and in some cases detailed supervision. Likewise in the case of labor organizations, we might well apply similar and equally well-defined principles of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public's interests as affected by their operations.<br /> <br /> Just as it is not desirable that a corporation shall be allowed to impose undue exactions upon the public, so it is not desirable that a labor organization shall be permitted to exact unfair terms of employment or subject the public to actual distresses in order to enforce its terms. Finally, just as we are earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjust and settle political differences between nations without resort to war, so we may well look about for means to settle the differences between organized capital and organized labor without resort to those forms of warfare which we recognize under the name of strikes, lockouts, boycotts, and the like.<br /> <br /> As we have great bodies of law carefully regulating the organization and operations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties and compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differences without the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans of conference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration, and judicial determination in controversies between labor and capital. To accomplish this would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoing code of practice in dealing with such affairs It might be well to frankly set forth the superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or the capital group. With rights, privileges, immunities, and modes of organization thus carefully defined, it should be possible to set up judicial or quasi judicial tribunals for the consideration and determination of all disputes which menace the public welfare.<br /> <br /> In an industrial society such as ours the strike, the lockout, and the boycott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as is war or armed revolution in the domain of politics. The same disposition to reasonableness, to conciliation, to recognition of the other side's point of view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes, ought to make it possible to solve the one set of questions aseasily as the other. I believe the solution is possible.<br /> <br /> The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care and deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elemental rights, dealing with the relations of employer and employee. This foundation in the law, dealing with the modern conditions of social and economic life, would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industry which a rejoicing nation would acclaim.<br /> <br /> After each war, until the last, the Government has been enabled to give homes to its returned soldiers, and a large part of our settlement and development has attended this generous provision of land for the Nation's defenders.<br /> <br /> There is yet unreserved approximately 200,000,000 acres in the public domain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible of reclamation and made fit for homes by provision for irrigation.<br /> <br /> The Government has been assisting in the development of its remaining lands, until the estimated increase in land values in the irrigated sections is full $500,000,000 and the crops of 1920 alone on these lands are estimated to exceed $100,000,000. Under the law authorization these expenditures for development the advances are to be returned and it would be good business for the Government to provide lor the reclamation of the remaining 20,000,000 acres, in addition to expediting the completion of projects long under way.<br /> <br /> Under what is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also to deposits of phosphates and other minerals on the public domain, leases are now being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large revenues to the Government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all royalties is to be paid directly to the Federal Treasury, and of the remainder 50 per centum is to be used for reclamation of arid lands by irrigation, and 40 per centum is to be paid to the States, in which the operations are located, to be used by them for school and road purposes.<br /> <br /> These resources are so vast, and the development is affording so reliable a basis of estimate, that the Interior Department expresses the belief that ultimately the present law will add in royalties and payments to the treasuries of the Federal Government and the States containing these public lands a total of $12,000,000,000. This means, of course, an added wealth of many times that sum. These prospects seem to afford every justification of Government advances in reclamation and irrigation.<br /> <br /> Contemplating the inevitable and desirable increase of population, there is another phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration. There are 79,000,000 acres of swamp and cut-over lands which may be reclaimed and made as valuable as any farm lands we possess. These acres are largely located in Southern States, and the greater proportion is owned by the States or by private citizens. Congress has a report of the survey of this field for reclamation, and the feasibility is established. I gladly commend Federal aid, by way of advances, where State and private participation is assured.<br /> <br /> Home making is one of the greater benefits which government can bestow. Measures are pending embodying this sound policy to which we may well adhere. It is easily possible to make available permanent homes which will provide, in turn, for prosperous American families, without injurious competition with established activities, or imposition on wealth already acquired.<br /> <br /> While we are thinking of promoting the fortunes of our own people, I am sure there is room in the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human beings who are suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. A severe drought in the Valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into grievous famine. Our voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save the lives of children in this area, but it is now evident that unless relief is afforded the loss of life will extend into many millions. America can not be deaf to such a call as that.<br /> <br /> We do not recognize the government of Russia, nor tolerate the propaganda which emanates therefrom, but we do not forget the traditions of Russian friendship. We may put aside our consideration of all international politics and fundamental differences in government. The big thing is the call of the suffering and the dying. Unreservedly I recommend the appropriation necessary to supply the American Relief Administration with 10,000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grains, not alone to halt the wave of death through starvation, but to enable spring planting in areas where the seed grains have been exhausted temporarily to stem starvation.<br /> <br /> The American Relief Administration is directed in Russia by former officers of our own armies, and has fully demonstrated its ability to transport and distribute relief through American hands without hindrance or loss. The time has come to add the Government's support to the wonderful relief already wrought out of the generosity of the American private purse.<br /> <br /> I am not unaware that we have suffering and privation at home. When it exceeds the capacity for the relief within the States concerned, it will have Federal consideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to our own heart promptings, and out of accord with the spirit which acclaims the Christmastide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten this burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine's peril.<br /> <br /> There are a full score of topics concerning which it would be becoming to address you, and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I have alluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I can not end this limited address without a suggested amendment to the organic law.<br /> <br /> Many of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant about altering the fundamental law. I think our tax problems, the tendency of wealth to seek nontaxable investment, and the menacing increase of public debt, Federal, State and municipal-all justify a proposal to change the Constitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bonds. No action can change the status of the many billions outstanding, but we can guard against future encouragement of capital's paralysis, while a halt in the growth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout our whole land.<br /> <br /> Such a change in the Constitution must be very thoroughly considered before submission. There ought to be known what influence it will have on the inevitable refunding of our vast national debt, how it will operate on the necessary refunding of State and municipal debt, how the advantages of Nation over State and municipality, or the contrary, may be avoided. Clearly the States would not ratify to their own apparent disadvantage. I suggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxable securities is hindering the flow of large capital to our industries, manufacturing, agricultural, and carrying, until we are discouraging the very activities which make our wealth.<br /> <br /> Agreeable to your expressed desire and in complete accord with the purposes of the executive branch of the Government, there is in Washington, as you happily know, an International Conference now most earnestly at work on plans for the limitation of armament, a naval holiday, and the just settlement of problems which might develop into causes of international disagreement.<br /> <br /> It is easy to believe a world-hope is centered on this Capital City. A most gratifying world-accomplishment is not improbable.</p>^

In the domestic field there is tranquility and contentment, harmonious relations between management and wage earner, freedom from industrial strife, and the highest record of years of prosperity. In the foreign field there is peace, the good will which comes from mutual understanding, and the knowledge that the problems which a short time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest friendship. The great wealth created by our enterprise and industry, and saved by our economy, has had the widest distribution among our own people, and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world. The requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury. Enlarging production is consumed by an increasing demand at hom6 and ail expanding commerce abroad. The country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism.</p><p>The main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and character of the American people. They have had great faith, which they have supplemented with inighty works. They have been able to put trust in each other and trust in their Government. Their candor in dealing with foreign governments hag commanded respect and confidence. Yet these remarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the Federal Government.</p><p>We have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resources. Wastefulness in public business and private enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy. This has been accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and more under a reign of law. A rule of force has been giving way to a rule of reason. We have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing expenditures, increasing tax rates, and diminishing profits the charmed circle of diminishing expenditures, diminishing tax rates, and increasing profits.</p><p>Four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system, abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others. Each time the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes and profits that a surplus has been ro, duced. One-third of the national debt has been paid, while much of the other two-thirds has been refunded at lower rates, and these savings of interest and constant economies have enabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions. Under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent, until it is estimated to stand well over $90,000,000,000. It gas been a method which has performed the secining miracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of the taxpayers 'with scarcely any diminution of the Government revenue. That is constructive economy in the highest degree. It is the corner stone of prosperity. It should not fail to be continued.</p><p>This action began by the application of economy to public expenditure. If it is to be permanent, it must be made so by the repeated application of economy. There is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time. Last June the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of $94,000,000. Under my direction the departments began saving all they could out of their present appropriations. The last tax reduction brought 'an encouraging improvement in business, beginning early in October, which w1,11 also increase our revenue. The combination of economy and good times now indicates a surplus of about $37,000,000. This is a margin of less than I percent on out, expenditures and makes it obvious that the Treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in ditures to be made before June 30. It is necessary therefor"Stuing the present session to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay, or if such are absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue; otherwise, we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget. For the first time during my term of office we face that contingency. I am certain that the Congress would not pass and I should not feel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that financial disgrace.</p><p>On the whole the finances of the Government are most satisfactory. Last year the national debt was reduced about $906,000,000. The refunding and retirement of the second and third Liberty loans have just been brought to a successful conclusion, which will save about $75,000,0W a year in interest. The unpaid balance has been arranged</p><p>in maturities convenient for carrying out our permanent debt-paying Program.</p><p>The enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate public need. The Government plant has been kept up and many improvements are tinder way, while its service is fully manned and the general efficiency of operation has increased. We have been enabled to undertake many new enterprises. Among these are the adjusted compensation of the veterans of the World War, which is costing us $112,000,000 a year; amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds, $20,000,000; increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including flood control, $43,000,000; public buildings, $47,000,000. In 1928 we spent $50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property. These are examples of a large list of items.</p><p>FOREIGN REIATIONS </p><p>When we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations, we likewise perceive peace and progress. The Sixth International Conference of American States was held at Habana last winter. It contributed to a better understanding and cooperation among the nations'. Eleven important conventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed. Pursuant to the plan then adopted, this Government has invited the other 20 nations of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration, which meets in Washington on December 10. All the nations have accepted and the expectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods for resolving international differences by means of arbitration.</p><p>During the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties, and 22 more are tinder negotiation.</p><p>NICARAGUA </p><p>When a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in Nicaragua, at the earnest and repeated entreaties of its Government I dispatched our Marine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens. To compose the contending parties, I sent there Col. Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary of War and now Governor General of the Philippine Islands, who secured an agreement that warfare should cease, a national election should be held and peace should be restored. Both parties conscientiously carried out this agreement, with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly surrendered or left the country. President Diaz appointed Brig. Gen. Frank R. McCoy, United States Army, president of the election board, which included also one member of each political party.</p><p>A free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully that both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this country at the election four years hence, to which I have refrained from making any commitments, although our country must be gratified at such an exhibition of success and appreciation</p><p>Nicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the direction of peaceful self-government.</p><p>TACNA-ARICA </p><p>The long-standing differences between Chile and Peru have been sufficiently composed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of ambassadors. Negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for the final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory.</p><p>MEXICO </p><p>Our relations with Mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution. Many misunderstandings have been resolved and the most frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all unsettled questions. It is exceedingly gratifying that Ambassador Morrow has been able to bring our two neighboring countries, which have so many interests in common, to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign rights.</p><p>CHINA </p><p>The situation in China which a few months ago was so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force has, been much composed. The Nationalist Government has established itself over the country and promulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the political and economic welfare of the people. We have recognized this Government,, encouraged its progress, and have negotiated a treaty restoring to China complete</p><p>tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens against discriminations. Our trade in that quarter is increasing and our forces are being reduced.</p><p>GREEK AND AUSTRIAN DEBTS </p><p>Pending before the Congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the Greek debt and the Austrian debt. both of these are comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous. The rehabilitation of these countries await& their settlement. There would also be advantages to our trade. We could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the relief which Austria seeks. The Congress has already granted Austria a long-time moratorium, which it is understood will be waived and immediate payments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to other countries.</p><p>PEACE TREATY </p><p>One of the most important treaties ever laid before the Senate of the United States will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at Paris, and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere, renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful means for the adjustment of international differences. It is the most solemn declaration against war, the most positive adherence to peace, that it is possible' for sovereign nations to</p><p>make. It does not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit us before the event to any mode of action which the Congress might decide to be wise. it ever the treaty should be broken. But it is a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nations to prevent their governments from beii4'forced into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities. The observance of this covenant, so simple and so straightforward, promises more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among the nations.</p><p>NATIONAL DEFENSE </p><p>The first duty of our Government to its own citizens and foreigners within its borders is the preservation of order. Unless and until that duty is met a government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of nations. The advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon that order among the people of different countries which we term peace. To insure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home and abroad, to preserve order, liberty, and peace by making the law supreme, we have an Army and a Navy.</p><p>Both of these are organized for defensive purposes. Our Army could not be much reduced, but does not need to be increased. Such new housing and repairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6-year program in aviation is being put into effect in both branches of our service.</p><p>Our Navy, according to generally accepted standards, is deficient in cruisers. We have 10 comparatively new vessels, 22 that are old, and 8 to be built. It is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided. This matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the Congress and does not need restatement. The bill before the Senate with the elimination of the time clause should be passed. We have no intention of competing with any other country. This building program is for necessary replacements and to meet our needs for defense.</p><p>The cost of national defense is stupendous. It has increased $118,000,000 in the past four years. The estimated expenditure for 1930 is $668,000,000. While this is made up of many items it is, after all, mostly dependent upon numbers. Our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of men in the Army or the Navy. We have reached the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose.</p><p>I wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic. Many people at home and abroad, who constantly make this charge, are the same ones who are even more solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries. When such assistance is granted, the inevitable result is that we have foreign interests. For us to refuse the customary support and protection of such interests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this Nation. Our largest foreign interests are in the British Empire, France, and Italy. Because we are constantly solicitous for those interests, I doubt if anyone would suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any militaristic or imperialistic design. As for smaller countries, we cer</p><p>tainly do not want any of them. We are more anxious than they are to have their sovereignty respected. Our entire influence is in behalf of their independence. Cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle.</p><p>The position of this Government relative to the limitation of armaments, the results already secured, and the developments up to the present time are so well known to the Congress that they do not require any restatement.</p><p>VETERANS </p><p>The magnitude of our present system of veterans' relief is without precedent, and the results have been far-reaching. For years a service pension has been granted to the Grand Army and lately to the survivors of the Spanish-American War. At the time we entered the World War however, Congress departed from the usual pension system followed by our Gove2rnment. Eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted, initiating a system of compensation, rehabilitation, hospitalization, and insurance for the disabled of the World War and their dependents. The administration 'of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult task, but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely. We should continue to foster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate care. It is the conception of our Government that the pension roll is an honor roll. It should include all those who are justly entitled to its benefits, but exclude all others.</p><p>Annual expenditures for all forms of veterans' relief now approximate $765,000,000, and are increasing from year to year. It is doubtful if the peak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come. Further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, the Disabled American Veterans of the World War, and other like organizations, and it may be necessary for administrative purposes, or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law, to make further changes. I am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted to the Congress will receive your careful consideration. But because of the vast expenditure now being made, each year, with every assurance that it will increase, and because of the great liberality of the existing law, the proposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the Congress.</p><p>You are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now dealing with matters of veterans' relief be consolidated in one Government department. Some advantages to this plan seem apparent, especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about a greater uniformity in the application of veterans' relief. I recommend that a survey be made by the proper committees of Congress dealing with this subject, in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation is desirable.</p><p>AGRICULTURE </p><p>The past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture. The general purchasing power of farm</p><p>products and the volume of production have advanced. This means not only further progress, in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in 1920-21, but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well-grounded confidence in the future of agriculture.</p><p>The livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is prospering conspicuously. Dairymen, beef producers, an poultrymen are receiving substantially larger returns than last year. Cotton, although lower in price than at this time last year, was produced in greater volume and the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable. But progress is never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry. Cash grains, hay, tobacco, and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this year than last. Present indications are, however, that the gross farm income will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927-28, when the total was $12,253,000,000. The corresponding figure for 1926-27 was $12,127,000,000, and in 1925-26, $12,670,000,000. Still better results would have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in the production of certain crops. This is particularly true of potatoes, which have sold at an unremunerative price, or at a loss, as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage.</p><p>The present status of agriculture, although greatly improved over that of a few years ago, bespeaks the need of further improvemen4 which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves, encouraged and assisted by wise public policy. The Government has been, and must continue to be, alive to the needs of agriculture.</p><p>In the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period. The Department of Agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency. The department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture. It is lending every possible assistance to cooperative marketing associations. Regulatory and research work have been segregated in order that each field may be served more effectively.</p><p>I can not too strongly commend, in the field of fact finding, the research work of the Department of Agriculture and the State experiment stations. The department now receives annually $4,000,000 more for research than in 1921. In addition, the funds paid to the States for experimentation purposes under the Purnell Act constitute an annual increase in Federal payments to State agricultural experiment stations of $2,400,000 over the amount appropriated in 1921. The program of support for research may wisely be continued and expanded. Since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an additional $2,000,000 for extension work, and this sum is to be increased next year under authorization by the Capper-Ketcham Act.</p><p>THE SURPLUS PROBLEM </p><p>While these developments in fundamental research, regulation, and dissemination of agricultural information are of distinct hell) to agriculture, additional effort is needed. The surplus problem demands attention. As emphasized in my last message, the Government should assume no responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage. The Government should,</p><p>however, provide reliable information as a guide to private effort; and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand, as a guide to production and marketing, should be encouraged. Expenditure of public funds to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny, so long as our farmers face unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already under cultivation.</p><p>Every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is adapted. The reforestation of land best suited for timber production is progressing and should be encouraged, and to this end the forest taxation inquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy. Improvement bas been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves, not only to protect the ranges, but to preserve the soil from erosion. Similar action is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now overgrazed and rapidly eroding.</p><p>Temporary expedients, though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of the moment, can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it. Hence putting the Government directly into business, subsidies, and price fixing, and the alluring promises of political action as a substitute for private initiative, should be avoided.</p><p>The Government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling surpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions. As a beginning there should be created a Federal farm board consisting of able and experienced men empowered to advise producers' associations in establishing central agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses, to seek wore economical means of merchandising, and to aid the producer in securing returns according to the a14 of his product. A revolving loan fund should be provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have developed means of financing their operations through regularly constituted credit institutions. Such a bill should carry authority for raising the money, by loans or otherwise, necessary to meet the expense, as the Treasury has no surplus.</p><p>Agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort which modern economic life demands. The cooperative movement, which is gradually building the needed organization, is in harmony with public interest and therefore merits public encouragement.</p><p>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATES </p><p>Important phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the sphere of the States. While successive reductions in Federal taxes have relieved most farmers of direct taxes to the National Government, State and local levies have become a serious burden. This problem needs immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment. It will have to be made largely by the States themselves.</p><p>COMMERCE </p><p>It is desirable that the Government continue its helpful attitude toward American business. The activities of the Department of Commerce have contributed largely to the present satisfactory posi</p><p>tion in our international trade, which has reached about $9,000,000,000 annually. There should be no slackening of effort in that direction. it is also important that the department's assistance to domestic commerce be continued. There is probably no way in which the Government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business men to reduce wastes in distribution.</p><p>COMMERCIAL AERONAUTICS </p><p>Continued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying. Demands for airplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the Department of Commerce to their capacity. While the compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, a Federal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary qualifications. State legislation, local airport regulations, and insurance requirements make such a license practically indispensable. This results in uniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation, which are essential to aeronautical development. Over 17,000 young men and women have now applied for Federal air pilot's licenses or permits. More than 80 per cent of them applied during the past year.</p><p>Our national airway system exceeds 14,000 miles in length and has 7,500 miles lighted for night operations. Provision has been made for lighting 4,000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal mileage with radio facilities. Three-quarters of our people are now served by these routes. With the rapid growth of air mail, express, and passenger service, this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important factor in commerce. It is noteworthy that this development has taken place without governmental subsidies. Commercial passenger flights operating on schedule have reached 13,000 miles per day.</p><p>During the next fortnight this Nation will entertain the nations of the world in a celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight. The credit for this epoch-making achievement belongs to a citizen of our own country, Orville Wright.</p><p>CUBAN PARCEL POST </p><p>I desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message, that Congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the Parcel Post Convention with Cuba, both as a facility to American commerce and as a measure of equity to Cuba in the one class of goods which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade.</p><p>"MAINE" BATTLESHIP MEMORIAL </p><p>When I attended the Pan American Conference at Habana, the President of Cuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was overturned by a storm after it was erected on the Cuban shore to the memory of the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship Maine. As a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the Cuban Government and people lie most gen</p><p>erously offered to present this to the. United States, and I assured him of my pleasure in accepting it. There is no location in the White House for placing so large and heavy a structure, and I therefore urge the Congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up.</p><p>RAILROADS </p><p>In previous annual messages I have suggested the enactment of laws to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency of transportation and lessening its cost to the public. While, consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is changed, vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully adequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation. Amendments designed to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the respective committees of Congress and a bill was reported out late in the last session which I understand has the approval in principle of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is to be hoped that this legislation may be enacted at an early date.</p><p>Experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition and clarification in several other respects, some of which have been pointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its annual reports to the Congress. It will promote the public interest to have the Congress give early consideration to the recommendations there made.</p><p>MERCHANT MARINE </p><p>The cost of maintaining the United States Government merchant fleet has been steadily reduced. We have established American flag lines in foreign trade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce and as a naval auxiliary. There have been sold to private American capital for operation within the past few years 14 of these lines, which, under the encouragement of the recent legislation passed by the Congress, give promise of continued successful operation. Additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control.</p><p>Through the cooperation of the Post Office Department and the Shipping Board long-term contracts are being made with American steamship lines for carrying mail, which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessels and the gradual reestablishment of the American merchant marine as a private enterprise. No action of the National Government has been so beneficial to our shipping. The cost is being absorbed to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the Shipping Board, for which the new law has made a market. Meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the Government operation until they can be transferred to private capital.</p><p>INTER-AMERICAN HIGHWAY </p><p>In my message last year I expressed the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this hemisphere South of the Rio Grande. My view has not changed.</p><p>The Pan American Union has recently indorsed it. In some of the countries to the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building. In, Others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult. As those countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of accomplishment. I prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end. We already furnish military and naval advisors, and following this precedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the Department of Agriculture.</p><p>We should provide our southern neighbors, if they request it, with such engineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges. Private t1literests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open main lines of travel. Such assistance should be given especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the countries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate, intercourse and closer relations among, them.</p><p>AIR MAIL SERVICE </p><p>The friendly relations and the extensive, commercial intercourse with the Western Hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air-mail routes. We shall soon have one from Key West, Fla., over Cuba, Haiti, and Santo Domingo to San Juan, P. R., where it will connect with another route to Trinidad. There will be another route from Key West to the Canal Zone, where connection will be made with a route across the northern coast of South America to Paramaribo. This will give us a circle around the Caribbean under our own control.. Additional connections will be made at Colon with a route running down the west coast of South America as far as Conception, Chile, and with the French air mail at Paramaribo running down the eastern coast of South America. 'The air service already spans our continent, with laterals running to Mexico and Canada, and covering a daily flight of over 28,000 miles, with an average cargo of 15 000 pounds.</p><p>WATERWAYS </p><p>Our river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor. In the past few years Ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work $28,000,000, besides what. is to be expended on flood control. The total appropriation for this year was over $91,000,000. The Ohio River is almost ready for opening; work on the Missouri and other rivers is under way. In accordance with the Mississippi flood law Army engineers are making investigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a view to flood control, navigation, waterpower, and irrigation. Our bar(re lines are being operated under generous appropriations, and negotiations are developing relative to the St. Lawrence waterway. To Secure the largest benefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the railroads, preferably by agreement, but otherwise as a result of congressional action.</p><p>We have recently passed several river and harbor bills. The work ordered by the Congress not, yet completed, will cost about $243,</p><p>000,000, besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the Mississippi flood way. Until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed, as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away.</p><p>IRRIGATION OF ARID LANDS </p><p>For many years the Federal Government has been committed to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation. While it has met with some failures due to unwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys, so that they could not be placed on a sound business basis, on the whole the service has been of such incalculable benefit in so many States that no one would advocate its abandonment. The program to which we are already committed, providing for the construction of new projects authorized by Congress and the completion of old projects, will tax the resources of the reclamation fund over a period of years. The high cost of improving and equipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant farms on federal projects.</p><p>Readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of May 25, 1926, have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers. These new financial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects have resulted in increased collections by the Department of the Interior of charges due the reclamation fund. Nevertheless, the demand for still smaller yearly payments on some projects continues. These conditions should have consideration in connection with any proposed new projects.</p><p>COLORADO RIVER </p><p>For several years the Congress has considered the erection of a dam on the Colorado River for flood-control, irrigation, and domestic water purposes, all of which ma properly be considered as Government functions. There would be an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating electricity. As private enterprise can very well fill this field, there is no need for the Government to go into it. It is unfortunate that the States interested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves. Nevertheless, any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective rights of each of them.</p><p>The Congress will have before it, the detailed report of a special board appointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project. From the short summary which I have seen of it, 11 judge they consider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost over previous estimates. They prefer the Black Canyon site. On the economic features they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many conditions which can not be established with certainty. So far as I can judge, however, from the summary, their conclusions appear sufficiently favorable, so that I feel warranted in recommending a measure which will protect the rights of the States, discharge the necessary Government functions, and leave the electrical field to private. enterprise.</p><p>MUSCLE SHOALS </p><p>The development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly. But we have it, and I am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for national defense and farm fertilizers. By dividing the property into its two component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to dispose of the power, reserving the right to any concern that wished to make nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose. Such a disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental about $2,000,000 per year. If the Congress would giant the Secretary of War authority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the largest production of nitrates, the entire property could begin to</p><p>function. Such a division, I am aware, has never seemed to appeal to the Congress. I should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrates.</p><p>I wish to avoid building another, (lam at public expense. Future operators should provide For that themselves. But if they were to be required to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevailing commercial rates for interest, this difficulty will be considerably lessened. Nor do I think this property should be made a vehicle for putting the United States Government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sales.</p><p>CONSERVATION </p><p>The practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conservation. This does not mean that every resource should not be developed to its full degree, but it means that none of them should be wasted. We have a conservation board working on our oil problem. This is of the utmost importance to the future well-being of our people in this age of oil-burning engines and tile general application of gasoline to transportation. The Secretary of the Interior should not be compelled to lease oil lands of the Osage Indians when the market is depressed and the future supply is in jeopardy.</p><p>While the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small, compared with the vast area in private ownership, the natural resources of those in public ownership are of immense present and future value. This is particularly trite as to minerals and water power. The proper bureaus have been classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved. Appropriate estimates are being submitted, in the Budget, for the further prosecution of this important work.</p><p>IMMIGRATION </p><p>The policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained. Authority should be granted the Secretary of Labor to give immediate preference to learned professions and experts essential to new industries. The reuniting of families should be expedited. Our immigration and naturalization laws might well be codified.</p><p>WAGE EARNER </p><p>In its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it the American conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production, which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity. Here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management and wage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, the end of which is not yet. The application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth. No discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people.</p><p>Since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 per cent, while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 per cent and 38 per cent. Even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent and in woolen mills 8.4 per cent, although these industries have not prospered like others. As the rise in living costs in this period is negligible, these figures represent real wage increases.</p><p>The cause of constructive economy requires that the Government should cooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from industrial accidents. This item, with all that has been done to reduce it, still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country.</p><p>WOMEN AND CHILDREN </p><p>The Federal Government should continue its solicitous care for the 8,500,000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health, which is reducing infant mortality and improving the 91odily and mental condition of our citizens.</p><p>CIVIL SERVICE </p><p>The most marked change made in the civil service of the Government in the past eight years relates to the increase in salaries. The Board of Actuaries on the retirement act shows by its report, that July 1, 1921 the average salary of the 330,047 employees subject to the act was J1,307, while on June 30, 1927, the average salary of the corresponding, 405,263 was $1,969. This was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent. On top of this was the generous increase made at the last session of the Congress generally applicable to Federal employees and another bill increasing the pay in certain branches of the Postal Service beyond the large increase which was made three years ago. This raised the average level from $1,969 to $2,092, making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent. While it is well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the Federal</p><p>service is much smaller than in private employment, in the lower brackets, ranging well up over $3,000, it is much higher. It is higher not only in actual money paid, but in privileges granted, a vacation of 30 actual working days, or 5 weeks each year, with additional time running in some departments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions of the retirement act. No other body of public servants ever occupied such a fortunate position.</p><p>EDUCATION </p><p>Through the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior the Federal Government, acting in an informative and advisory capacity, has rendered valuable service. While this province be7crigspeculiarly to the States, yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational methods is a general responsibility of the Federal Government. A survey of negro colleges and universities in the United States has just been completed l7y the Bureau of Education through funds provided by the institutions themselves and through private sources. The present status of negro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its advancement. This was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the bureau. Following the invitation of the Association of Land Grant Colleges and Universities, he Bureau of Education now has under way the survey of agricultural colleges, authorized by Congress. The purpose of the survey is to ascertain the accomplishments, the status, and the future objectives of this type of educational training. It is now proposed to undertake a survey of secondary schools, which educators insist is timely and essential.</p><p>PUBLIC BUILDINGS </p><p>We, have laid out a public building program for the District of Columbia and the country at large runni110' into hundreds of millions of dollars. Three important structures and one annex are already, under way and one addition has been completed in the City of Washington. in the country sites have been acquired, many buildings are in course of construction, and some are already completed. Plans for all this work are being prepared in order that it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible. This is the greatest building program ever assumed by this Nation. It contemplates structures of utility and of beauty. When it reaches completion the people will be well served and the Federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and stately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world.</p><p>THE AMERICAN INDIAN </p><p>The administration of Indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for several years. The Department of the Interior has been able to provide better supervision of health, education, and industrial advancement of this native race through additional funds provided by the Congress. The present cooperative arrangement existing between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Public Health Service should be extended. The Government's responsibility to the American Indian has been acknowledged by annual increases in appropria.l</p><p>tions to fulfill its obligations to them and to hasten the time when Federal supervision of their affairs may be properly and safely terminated. The movement in Congress and in some of the State legislatures for extending responsibility in Indian affairs to States should be encouraged. A complete participation by the Indian in our economic life is the end to be desired.</p><p>THE NEGRO </p><p>For 65 years now our negro Population has been under the peculiar care and solicitude of the National Government. The progress which they have made in education and the professions, in wealth and in the arts of civilization, affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world history. They have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages of our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent existence. Whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume, the status granted to them by the Constitution of this Union is being rapidly dissipated. Their cooperation in the life of the Nation is constantly enlarging.</p><p>Exploiting the Negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and their protection is being increased by those States in which their percentage of population is largest. Every encouragement should be extended for t le development of the race. The colored people have been the victims of the crime of lynching, which has in late years somewhat decreased. Some parts of the South already have wholesome laws for its restraint and punishment. Their example might well be followed by other States, and by such immediate remedial legislation as the Federal Government can extend under the Constitution.</p><p>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS </p><p>Under the guidance of Governor General Stimson the economic and political conditions of the Philippine Islands have been raised to a standard never before surpassed. The cooperation between his administration and the people of the islands is complete and harmonious. It would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be granted by the Congress to our citizens doing business in the islands.</p><p>PORTO RICO </p><p>Due to the terrific storm that swept Porto Rico last September, the people of that island suffered large losses. The Red Cross and the War Department went to their rescue. The property loss is being, retrieved. Sugar, tobacco, citrus fruit, and coffee, all suffered damage. The first three can largely look after themselves. The coffee growers will need some assistance, which should be *extended strictly on a business basis, and only after most careful investigation. The people of Porto Rico are not asking for charity.</p><p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE </p><p>It is desirable that all the legal activities of the Government be consolidated under the supervision of the Attorney General. In</p><p>1870 it was felt necessary to create the Department of Justice for this purpose. During the intervening period, either through legislation creating law officers or departmental action, additional legal positions not under the supervision of the Attorney General have been provided until there are now over 900. Such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the Government now as it was in 1870, and should be corrected by appropriate legislation.</p><p>SPECIAL GOVERNMENT COUNSEL </p><p>In order to prosecute the oil cases, I suggested and the Congress enacted a law providing for the appointment of two special counsel. They have pursued their work with signal ability, recovering all the leased lands besides nearly $30,000,000 in money, and nearly $17,000,000 in other property. They find themselves hampered by a statute, which the Attorney General construes as applying to them, prohibiting their appearing for private clients before any department. For this reason, one has been compelled to resign. No good result is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel, and as Mr. Roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated I recommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office exempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving the Government.</p><p>PROHIBITION </p><p>The country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment. Those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal. Meantime) it is binding upon the National and State Governments and all our inhabitants. The Federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent violations, especially through smuggling, manufacture, and transportation, and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence. It is bound to continue this policy. Under the terms of the Constitution, however, the obligation is equally on the States to exercise the power which they have through the executive, legislative. judicial, and police branches of their governments in behalf of enforcement. The Federal Government is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction and is entitled to7the active cooperation of the States.</p><p>CONCLUSION </p><p>The country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it has ever before experienced. But, having reached this position, we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lost. It needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world. We shall not be permitted to take our case, but shall continue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil. The actions of the Government must command the confidence of the country. Without this, our prosperity would be lost. We must extend to other countries the largest measure of generosity, moderation, and patience. In addition to dealing justly, we can well afford to walk humbly.</p><p>The end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a more</p><p>abundant life. Peace and prosperity are not finalities; they are only methods. It is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate. This test has come to the United States. Our country has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its intellectual, moral, and spiritual life. The issue is in the hands of the people. Our faith in man and God is the justification for the belief in our continuing success.</p><p>^
